  <h1>TUG Newbie Page</h1>
  <p>This page intends to introduce new members to TUG and the TUG web page, and also consolidate all the TUG content that might be useful to new ukulele players.</p>

  <h2> <a href="https://tuesdayukes.org/uke_camp.html">Uke Camp</a> </h2>
  <p> If you've never picked up a ukulele, the "Uke Camp" page provides video
  introduction to the instrument, along with a <a href="https://tuesdayukes.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Uke_Camp_02_20.pdf">PDF book</a>
</p>

<h2><a href="https://tuesdayukes.org/senior_singalong.html">Senior Sing</a> </h2>
<p>
  Senior Sing is a collection of simple play-along videos. The chord books are available here:
<a href="https://tuesdayukes.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Senior-Sing-1.pdf">Book One</a>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qtj1t6snapu1bux/Senior%20Sing%202.pdf?dl=0">Book Two</a>
</p>

<h2> <a href="https://tuesdayukes.org/member_videos.html">Member Videos</a></h2>
<p>
  Many of the member videos are good play-alongs, with music on-screen. Some of the videos are just for watching, and don't include music.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://tuesdayukes.org/Favorite%20Songs.html">Favorite Songs</a></h2>
<p>
Our favorite songs list contains relatively simple songs that we periodically
repeat in our meetings. If you'd like to lead a song during a meeting, this is a
good list to choose from.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://tuesdayukes.org/PDFLinks.html">Music Archive</a></h2>
<p>
  The Music Archive contains most of the songs we've played since the beginning
  of 2020. If you're looking for music to a song you know, this is a good place
  to start.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://tuesdayukes.org/music/scripts/VideoIndex%20History.html">Meeting Video Indices</a></h2>
<p>
  Since early 2020, we have recorded all our meetings on Zoom. This page
  includes an index to all the songs we've played. Many of the songs include a
  link to a song sheet. The timestamp on each line takes you to the portion of
  the YouTube video with that song's performance.
</p>

<h2>Music Format</h2>
<p>
  Our music is stored in the <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChordPro#:~:text=The%20ChordPro%20(also%20known%20as,ukulele%2C%20bass%20guitar%20or%20mandolin.">ChordPro</a>
  format. This is a simple text file where chords are embedded within the lyrics
  in square brackets. For example:<br>
  <strong>What [Em]child is [G]this, who, [D]laid to rest </strong><br>
</p>
<p>
  We use <a href="https://onsongapp.com/">OnSong</a> to display the music
  during our meetings, and we often use <a href="https://chordpro.org/chordpro/chordpro-installation/">ChordPro</a> to
  generate a PDF from the .chopro file.
</p>

<h2>Music Submission</h2>
<p>
  If you'd like to submit a song for us to play, but don't have it in the
  ChordPro format, feel free to send any format you have handy. If you found
  your music on another web site, please provide a URL link to your source.
</p>
<p>
  Send your music to <a href="mailto:c.paul.butler@gmail.com">c.paul.butler@gmail.com</a>
  a few days before the meeting. Paul will do whatever formatting seems
  necessary, add the music to the archive, and forward to new files to Gary for
  projection on Tuesday.
