<PRE>I hope this is the final version for Time Warp. Please note that I had the lead break in the wrong place; it comes between the final two choruses. Also, during the lead break we should do short single strums. The chords for the lead break look like this: 

A&#160; /&#160; Bb7~B7&#160; /&#160; G&#160; /&#160; D&#160; /&#160; A&#160; /&#160; A&#160; /&#160; Bb7~B7
It's a single strum with a hard stop for the A chord, followed by a slide up from a Bb7 to the B7 (sounding like two strums) before the hard stop. 

You can practice it with the video at <A HREF="https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?p=time+warp+rocky+horror+picture+show&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;hspart=mozilla&amp;hsimp=yhs-001.">https://search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?p=time+warp+rocky+horror+picture+show&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;hspart=mozilla&amp;hsimp=yhs-001.</A> The lead break (tap dance part) comes at about the 3:22 mark. 

I hope this helps us get it right. Thanks for your patience.

Studio B is getting the floor painted this week - so we'll be meeting at Dart Bowl on Tuesday night (September 15). Dart Bowl is just south of Koenig, between Lamar and Woodrow - so it kind of splits the difference between Central Market and Kevin's house. There is PLENTY of parking.

Dart Bowl
5700 Grover Ave.
Austin, TX 78756
(512) 452-2518

We have the meeting room reserved from 7:00 to 9:00, it has plenty of room, and there is a bar and cafe is you want drinks and or food. If you have a portable music stand, it would probably be a good idea to bring it along. I've got a little projector that might work - but the walls have carpet - so there's no really any place to project. We'll try to figure it out -but better safe than sorry. 

When you come in, just take a left, and go all the way down to the end by the lockers - the meeting room is right there. 

Hope to see you there
