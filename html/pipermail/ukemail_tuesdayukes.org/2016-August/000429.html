<PRE>Sorry I have not made it to many of these meetings. &#160;My boyfriend Wayne and I plan to attend tonight, and the flash mob sounds fun.

Hi TUG,
Please check out the email below from Jen (the superstar with Bob creating the Austin Ukulele Society). &#160;If there are any TUG folks who can participate in the Flash Mob she is describing below, please email her ASAP. &#160;If there are TUG folks who can make it, I'd love to practice the three songs tomorrow and the following week during TUG. &#160; &#160;
So, please let Jen know if you can make it (the date is Wednesday&#160;8/31). &#160;
Jen, unfortunately I can't make it that&#160;Wednesday evening due to another (not as fun) obligation.
Thank you all and Jen - thanks so much for thinking of us
Take care,
Nancy

Hi, Nancy!

I hope the start to the school year goes smoothly for you!

The Austin Ukulele Society ensemble was asked to do a flash mob style performance on Wed 8/31 at about 8pm at Guero's; we were hoping to increase our presence by joining forces with additional members of TUG! Do you think you could ask them via email or in person tomorrow? It would be helpful to know soonish; you can ask anyone interested to email me <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">ataustinukes at gmail.com.</A>&#160; Basically, we will play just three songs - &quot;Wagon Wheel,&quot; &quot;Margaritaville&quot; and &quot;On the Road Again.&quot; We won't have music stands, so either memorization or ukulele-side cheat sheets would be necessary. There is live music at Guero's from 6-8, and we'll just surprise the audience after the bands finish.

Please let me know your thoughts - we'd love to have you and/or members from TUG join us!

Best,
Jen
