Hi, friends!

We're so glad you can participate in the ukulele flash mob this coming Wednesday.

We'll perform just three songs - &quot;Margaritaville,&quot; &quot;Wagon Wheel&quot; and &quot;On the Road Again.&quot; We will not have music stands, so please memorize the songs and/or have little cheat sheets on your ukulele. Guero's has a concert series most every Wednesday evening, from 6-8pm - we'll surprise the crowd and play at 8pm, just after the bands finish.

Performance Date &amp; time: Wednesday, August 31st, at approximately 8pm

Performance location: Guero's, under the oaks, 1412 S. Congress Ave, Austin, TX, 78704 (there is street parking on S. Congress - just watch out for resident only parking on some blocks surrounding South Congress Ave)

Meet up time &amp; spot: 7:30pm - spot: TBD - I'll chat with the coordinators at Sun Radio and send an update by Tuesday 8/30

Attire: casual - Austin Ukulele Society t-shirt always appreciated :)


If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best regards,
Jen (512-541-0422 - mobile)
