<PRE>I hate missing TUG two weeks in a row, but I probably will. 

After extensive online shopping plus double- and triple-checking all the consumer reviews, I finally bought a new camping tent! This is a long overdue purchase for me, and I'm pretty excited about it. According to Amazon tracking, it should get here by 8 PM today, and I definitely want to be her when it arrives. 
Can I suggest a theme for next month's TUG meetings in absentia? Rock-n-roll.&#160;John Davenport (a.k.a. &quot;THE John Davenport&quot;)

Subject: Ukulele Flash Mob - Wed 8/31 at 8pm at Guero's - general info&#160;Hi, friends!
We're so glad you can participate in the ukulele flash mob this coming Wednesday.&#160;
We'll perform just three songs - &quot;Margaritaville,&quot; &quot;Wagon Wheel&quot; and &quot;On the Road Again.&quot; We will&#160;not&#160;have music stands, so please memorize the songs and/or have little cheat sheets on your ukulele.&#160;Guero's has a concert series most every Wednesday evening, from 6-8pm - we'll surprise the crowd and play at 8pm, just after the bands finish.&#160;

Performance Date &amp; time:&#160;Wednesday, August 31st, at approximately 8pm
Performance location:&#160;Guero's, under the oaks, 1412 S. Congress Ave, Austin, TX, 78704 (there is street parking on S. Congress - just watch out for resident only parking on some blocks surrounding South Congress Ave)
Meet up time &amp; spot:&#160;7:30pm - spot: TBD - I'll chat with the coordinators at Sun Radio and send an update by Tuesday 8/30
Attire:&#160;casual - Austin Ukulele Society t-shirt always appreciated :)
