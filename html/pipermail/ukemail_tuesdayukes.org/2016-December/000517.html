<PRE>I've pulled Peggy Sue off the Drop Box site - the uke 2 part was too 
complex - so I'm going to simplify it. I'll post it back up once I've 
figured out a new Uke 2 part.

I have done a version of Stray Cat Strut which is now up -it has a nice 
simple melody line, and neat uke 2 and bass parts. The chord progression 
is also neat - it has a nice walkdown with a couple of options. So, I 
think we'll do STray Cat Strut as our second piece. We'll take a look at 
Tuesday.

The files are here:

We need to start picking the parts we're going to play - so take a look 
at the music and see what you might be interested in playing. You don't 
have to lock it - but it would be nice to cover all the parts so we can 
hear what it will sound like. We'll mostly be working from paper - so 
bring a music stand if you have one. I'll have some extra copies of the 
parts at the rehearsal - so we should be able to cover everyone.

Here's the rehearsal sheet - this is what we'll focus on at the rehearsal

     Decide how we'll arrange it to play at AUS
