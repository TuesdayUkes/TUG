<PRE>Dave,

Bah!  Humbug!  I will be out of town on December 28 and will not be able to
attend your Holiday Bash.  Thank you for the invitation - I hope you have a
jolly time.  

 

Merry Christmas to you and Maureen - and to one and all in TUG!

 

Gary

Happy Holiday TUGsters! Soon the big day will be part of Christmas past, and
we'll all be relaxing from the shopping craze. Before you put those Holiday
Songs away and get ready for the New Year, let's get together and play some
tunes. We have plenty of space, so bring your significant others along and
we'll include them in the fun! Don't forget your favorite music books and
songs to share.

For some of you, we are on the far side of the moon, but please consider
taking the trek and we'll reward your efforts with a nice dinner and a fine
drink selection. We live near the Dell Diamond (baseball park), on the East
side of Round Rock.
