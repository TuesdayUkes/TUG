<PRE>We had a blast playing this last week in TUG! The original is in Db, and
it's in C in the Halifax Ukulele Gang songbook
&lt;<A HREF="https://halifaxukulelegang.wordpress.com/hug-songbook/">https://halifaxukulelegang.wordpress.com/hug-songbook/</A>&gt;, but Betsy thinks
G would be a good key.

Give it a listen and see if there's a part you'd like to play or sing!

Here's the Jimmy Fallon/Melissa McCarthy lip-synch battle Deanna shared
that started it all.

*Brand New Key (Melanie Safka) *



[G] I rode my bicycle past your window last night

[D7] I roller skated to your door at daylight

[G] It almost seems like you're avoiding me

[C] I'm okay alone, but you got [D7] something I need



Well, [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, you got a brand new key

I think that we should get together and try them out you see

[C] I been looking around awhile, you got something for me

Oh! [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, [D7] you got a brand new
[G] key



[G] I ride my bike, I roller skate, don't drive no car

[D7] Don't go too fast, but I go pretty far

For [G] somebody who don't drive well I&#8217;ve been all around the world

[C] Some people say, I done all [D7] right for a girl



Well, [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, you got a brand new key

I think that we should get together and try them out you see

[C] I been looking around awhile, you got something for me

Oh! [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, [D7] you got a brand new
[G] key



[G] I asked your mother if you were at home

[D7] She said, yes .. but you weren't alone

Oh, [G] sometimes I think that you're avoiding me [

F] I'm okay alone, but you've got [D7] something I need



Well, [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, you got a brand new key

I think that we should get together and try them out you see

[C] La la la la la la la la, [D7] la la la la la la

Oh! [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, [D7] you got a brand new
[G] key
