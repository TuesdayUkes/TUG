<PRE>Since we have a new TUG location, we're going to change things up over 
the next few months and see how it goes.

Every other week (starting this week) we'll be having our regular PPP 
(Pick, Pass, or Play) session. On the in between weeks we'll focus in on 
a few songs each month - we'll have multiple parts for folks who want to 
pick (in notation and TABS) - as well as chords - and lyrics. We'll work 
on three songs at a time that fit together in a set. These in-between 
weeks will be known as the Interstitial TUG Band. We'll mostly rehearse 
from paper copies. There will be parts for every skill level - and we 
think this will (hopefully) add something fun and rewarding to TUG.

To start us off - we have 3 Holiday Songs - Mele Kalikimaka, Carol of 
the Bells, and  What Are you Doing New Year's Eve. All the parts are here:

The LEAD parts have the chords, lyrics, and melody line. The other parts 
have TABS as well as notation. The first Insterstitial meeting will be 
Dec 6.

We'll email reminders each week so we can keep straight what we'll be 
doing at each TUG meeting.
