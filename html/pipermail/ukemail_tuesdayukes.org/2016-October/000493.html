<PRE>So this Tuesday we're meeting at Central Market at 7:00 - probably 
downstairs or upstairs or inside or outside - we'll see when we get 
there were we can get a spot that's not too noisy. Come out and have a 
drink and play and sing with us.

In other news - starting November 15 we'll be meeting at Hancock 
Recreation Center in the downstairs classroom. Hancock is at 811 E. 41st 
Street, you turn off 41st and up a little driveway to get there  - it's 
also the entrance for Hancock Golf Course. We haven't seen the room yet 
- and we'll be working out things like a projector, etc as we go. Austin 
Rec will post TUG up on their web site, and we'll be added to their 
catalog of activities. We'll add the address for the meeting to our post 
on the Austin Ukulele Society web site as well - so it should make it 
simpler for those folks to find us. Austin Rec has asked us to provide 
some TUG pictures that they can use on their web site - so we'll be 
doing snaps over the next few meetings.

See you all at Central Market
