<PRE>Aloha TUG!  

As you may recall, I have been asked to solicit your performance at Hope
Presbyterian Church in NW Austin on Wednesday, October 5 in the early
evening.   Hope Presbyterian Church is located at 11512 Olson Drive, Austin,
TX 78750.  Here is a link to a map and directions to the church.

Hope puts on a pot luck dinner on the first Wednesday of each month and
tries to have some form of entertainment during the dinner.  The dinner
starts at 5:45 p.m., and they are hoping that TUG can play the half hour
from 6:00-6:30.  They will save a meal for all TUG folks (and I will buy the
first round of beers at BB Rovers afterwards).  The last time I attended
this pot luck dinner, they had an accordion band entertain, so ukuleles will
be the epitome of sophistication for the church attendees.  I'm guessing
about 50 people will attend (based upon my single attendance to one of these
pot lucks).  

This is a fairly progressive church, so while a bit of self-censorship is
probably not a bad idea, I'm pretty sure that most of the songs you wish to
play should be fine.  I appreciate your willingness to trek out to NW Austin
and to play.  

Keep on strummin'

 

Gary Goble
