<PRE>Awesome Gary!  Thanks for the gig :)

Let's solidify the details/songs this Tuesday.  I really like Kevin's idea
of having this be similar to the way Jack set up the gig at Westminster
Manor (with several smaller groups playing a song or two and then a song or
two with the big group and possible sing along).

If you plan to participate please show to TUG on Tuesday and/or email any
ideas you want to share.  This will be a lot of fun.

Take care,

Nancy

&gt;<i> Aloha TUG!

</I>&gt;<i> As you may recall, I have been asked to solicit your performance at Hope
</I>&gt;<i> Presbyterian Church in NW Austin on Wednesday, October 5 in the early
</I>&gt;<i> evening.   Hope Presbyterian Church is located at 11512 Olson Drive,
</I>&gt;<i> Austin, TX 78750.  Here is a link to a map and directions to the church.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://hopeaustin.org/map-and-directions/">http://hopeaustin.org/map-and-directions/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope puts on a pot luck dinner on the first Wednesday of each month and
</I>&gt;<i> tries to have some form of entertainment during the dinner.  The dinner
</I>&gt;<i> starts at 5:45 p.m., and they are hoping that TUG can play the half hour
</I>&gt;<i> from 6:00-6:30.  They will save a meal for all TUG folks (and I will buy
</I>&gt;<i> the first round of beers at BB Rovers afterwards).  The last time I
</I>&gt;<i> attended this pot luck dinner, they had an accordion band entertain, so
</I>&gt;<i> ukuleles will be the epitome of sophistication for the church attendees.
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m guessing about 50 people will attend (based upon my single attendance
</I>&gt;<i> to one of these pot lucks).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a fairly progressive church, so while a bit of self-censorship is
</I>&gt;<i> probably not a bad idea, I&#8217;m pretty sure that most of the songs you wish to
</I>&gt;<i> play should be fine.  I appreciate your willingness to trek out to NW
</I>&gt;<i> Austin and to play.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep on strummin&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>
