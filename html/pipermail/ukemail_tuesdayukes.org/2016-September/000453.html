Nancy, Gary,

 

Betsy, Angela and I would like to play our uke/flute arrangement of Amazing Grace at the Hope gig. I think it will work really well for this crowd. We played this at one of Kevin's rehearsals. Here is a link

Awesome Gary!  Thanks for the gig :)

Let's solidify the details/songs this Tuesday.  I really like Kevin's idea of having this be similar to the way Jack set up the gig at Westminster Manor (with several smaller groups playing a song or two and then a song or two with the big group and possible sing along).

If you plan to participate please show to TUG on Tuesday and/or email any ideas you want to share.  This will be a lot of fun.

Take care,

Nancy

Aloha TUG!  

As you may recall, I have been asked to solicit your performance at Hope Presbyterian Church in NW Austin on Wednesday, October 5 in the early evening.   Hope Presbyterian Church is located at 11512 Olson Drive, Austin, TX 78750.  Here is a link to a map and directions to the church.  <A HREF="http://hopeaustin.org/map-and-directions/">http://hopeaustin.org/map-and-directions/</A> 

Hope puts on a pot luck dinner on the first Wednesday of each month and tries to have some form of entertainment during the dinner.  The dinner starts at 5:45 p.m., and they are hoping that TUG can play the half hour from 6:00-6:30.  They will save a meal for all TUG folks (and I will buy the first round of beers at BB Rovers afterwards).  The last time I attended this pot luck dinner, they had an accordion band entertain, so ukuleles will be the epitome of sophistication for the church attendees.  I&#8217;m guessing about 50 people will attend (based upon my single attendance to one of these pot lucks).  

This is a fairly progressive church, so while a bit of self-censorship is probably not a bad idea, I&#8217;m pretty sure that most of the songs you wish to play should be fine.  I appreciate your willingness to trek out to NW Austin and to play.  

Keep on strummin&#8217;
