<PRE>Hi Gang-
Redux:  I've just conferred with Polk and Angela, and we are IN for &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.
However, I am bowing out for the other numbers.
Hope that's OK.  Sorry for the confusion.
--Betsy

Hi All,



OK here's what I gathered from last night at TUG, please respond if anything is not 100% correct.



Confirmed:

1.  Group - Polk, Angel and Betsy:  Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace (awesome).

2.  Solo - The John Davenport:  Thank You My Ukulele (a great original).

3.  Group - Gary and Nancy:  A surprised to be determined (can't wait to 'unwrap it').

4.  Dave:  On backup bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)

5:  Deanna (with her beautiful voice, possible providing harmony with Betsy on the group songs)

6.  Group - Two TUG group songs:  California Stars and ______  (I am not sure what the second song is?)



Not attending or not confirmed:

Kendall will be with her husband enjoying his birthday.

Kevin J is 50/50 due to work scheduling.

Mike will be enjoying a holiday (I believe it is a holiday?) with his wife.



Gary said he can get a mic or two.  I am not sure of anything else that might be needed?



I think we have time for another song or two or three (better to have too much than not enough).  Anyone else or group want to join in?



Thanks,



Nancy
