<PRE>Hi Nancy,

 

Nancy Lynch and I are hoping to play 3 songs &#8211; one folk, one country, and one pop.  Is that overdoing it? 

 

By the way, I really appreciate everyone&#8217;s willingness to play that evening.  

 

Gary

Hi TUG, Gary and Nancy -

Thanks for the updates and questions!

I am available that Wednesday 5:00 until 6:30 sharp to help with anything from singing to playing to setting up. Let me/us know what time to show up and lend a hand.

If you need me to sing a harmony part or a solo as the group plays, I am available (within a lower range...D-ish to A/B-ish), but prefer a week's notice on a song selection, arrangement and key to prepare.

That said, mostly happy to support, but don't feel compelled nor opposed to performing a &quot;solo&quot; act. Open to whatever you need!

And, sadly can't make this Tuesday to TUG. I have my first ever voice lesson. Hooray!

Cheers!
Deanna

Sounds great!!!

 

Here's what I have confirmed, please let me know if this is wrong and if you have answers to the questions in bold:

 

Confirmed Solo Groups/Individual Act:

1.  Group - Polk, Angel and Betsy:  Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace 

2.  Solo - The John Davenport:  Thank You My Ukulele 

3.  Group - Gary and Nancy:  A surprised to be determined (not sure if one or two songs, can you let me know?)

4.  Group - Brock, Charlie and (maybe Christine):  One or Two Songs (please let me know, when y'all know)

 

General Information and (my questions):

Dave:  On backup bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)

Deanna:  I am not sure if open to singing individually or in a group (either way, great talent). 

TUG Group:  Anyone interested in leading the group with a TUG song or two?

 

Also, please remember:   

Jack has reserved a room at Ruiz Library for 9/24 Sat from 1pm - 4pm - it would be a good time/place for any Tugsters who want to get in a practice session for the Hope sessions.

 

Have a great weekend and take care,

 

Nancy

Hi Nancy,

If you have room Brock and I and maybe Christine (she might be busy) would like to join in for a song or two. Let me know what you think.

Hi All,

 

OK here's what I gathered from last night at TUG, please respond if anything is not 100% correct.

 

Confirmed:

1.  Group - Polk, Angel and Betsy:  Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace (awesome).

2.  Solo - The John Davenport:  Thank You My Ukulele (a great original).

3.  Group - Gary and Nancy:  A surprised to be determined (can't wait to 'unwrap it').

4.  Dave:  On backup bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)

5:  Deanna (with her beautiful voice, possible providing harmony with Betsy on the group songs)

6.  Group - Two TUG group songs:  California Stars and ______  (I am not sure what the second song is?)

 

Not attending or not confirmed:

Kendall will be with her husband enjoying his birthday.

Kevin J is 50/50 due to work scheduling.

Mike will be enjoying a holiday (I believe it is a holiday?) with his wife.

 

Gary said he can get a mic or two.  I am not sure of anything else that might be needed?

 

I think we have time for another song or two or three (better to have too much than not enough).  Anyone else or group want to join in?

 

Thanks,

 

Nancy
