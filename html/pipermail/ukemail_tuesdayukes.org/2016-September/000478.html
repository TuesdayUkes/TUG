<PRE>I'd like to do my group song, &quot;Thank My Ukulele,&quot; first. The solo song is called &quot;Every Person in the World.&quot; 

If y'all want to use the Oct 4 TUG meeting for dress rehearsal, I'll host it at my place. It's not too far from Hope Presbyterian.&#160; &#160;John Davenport (a.k.a. &quot;THE John Davenport&quot;)

Hi All,
I added some more information to the chart below, including moving John around so Polk will have time setting up&#160;his amp, as well as adding the names of the songs Gary and Nancy are playing. &#160;I hope y'all are cool with the changes.
Please let me know if there are any concerns. &#160;Also as a reminder, no TUG tonight but there will be TUG next Tuesday.

Could I ask that&#160;we move Thank My Uke down one or more slots, maybe after John's individual song. I will be playing a baritone on the first two songs and a tenor&#160;with John. I plan on using an amp so I would like a little&#160;time to change over.
Thanks,polk&#160;

Subject: Re: [Ukemail] Gary's Gig - Hope Church&#160;Hi TUG, Gary and Nancy -Thanks for the updates and questions!I am available that Wednesday 5:00 until 6:30 sharp to help with anything from singing to playing to setting up. Let me/us know what time to show up and lend a hand.If you need me to sing a harmony part or a solo as the group plays, I am available (within a lower range...D-ish to A/B-ish), but prefer a week's notice on a song selection, arrangement and key to prepare.That said, mostly happy to support, but don't feel compelled nor opposed to performing a &quot;solo&quot; act. Open to whatever you need!And, sadly can't make this Tuesday to TUG. I have my first ever voice lesson. Hooray!Cheers!

Could I ask that&#160;we move Thank My Uke down one or more slots, maybe after John's individual song. I will be playing a baritone on the first two songs and a tenor&#160;with John. I plan on using an amp so I would like a little&#160;time to change over.
Thanks,polk&#160;

Subject: Re: [Ukemail] Gary's Gig - Hope Church &#160;Hi Gary -&#160; &#160;It's looking like the TUG group is no longer performing a song, other than the side groups that are filling the slots. Did I read this right? Anyhow, willing to help, but not seeing that I'm needed. &#160;Wednesdays are bustling for me. I have a class at 7 followed by an 8:30 obligation. I'm still willing to help you set up, etc, but do let me know if you decide you need me or not. &#160;Cheers!Deanna_______________________________________________
