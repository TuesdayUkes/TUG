<PRE>

So, the last three summers I've told myself I was going to work through Aaron Keim's Fingerstyle Ukulele &#160;book - (<A HREF="http://quietamericanmusic.com/storestore/fingerstyle-ukulele-instruction-book-1&#160;$20">http://quietamericanmusic.com/storestore/fingerstyle-ukulele-instruction-book-1&#160;$20</A>). But when I pulled it out yet again this year it was clear it had been untouched by human hands.&#160;

So, I'm putting together a group to work through the book this summer. We'll meet every other Monday ay 7:30 - at my house (plenty of stands/chairs/dog hair). &#160;The book breaks down into 6 nice sections, all TABS (no note reading). You don't need a low-g uke, and while there are bari parts for some of the pieces, it would probably be easier to work with the group with a regular uke. We'll intro the exercises for each section at one meeting &#160;- work on them for 2 weeks - and then work on the songs for that section at the next meeting. I'll put together a couple of fingerpicking warm ups we can use as well to start each session - and once we get closer I'll do a little rough syllabus so we can stay on track. Nothing is set in stone - we could stay on a section for a couple of meetings - we'll see how it goes.&#160;

If anyone out there is interested just holler at me.&#160;

Kevin
