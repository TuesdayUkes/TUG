Subject: Hey, Tuesday Uke Group
Date: 2018-06-27 19:08
 From: Richard Cogbill &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">richardcogbill at gmail.com</A>&gt;

I'm stuck in Los Angeles for another week on some business and family
matters.  Hope to see y'all the second Tuesday in July.

I actually have my uke with me. Gave a friend's wife her first real
ukulele lesson. Now she wants to buy real good one (she's only has a not
so quality soprano one borrowed from a friend whose son never played
it).
She's even a &quot;leftie&quot; and is learning to play right handed and did very
well for her first lesson!

Several folks in her church singing group want to learn and their new
music director is a uke player so will be giving them lessons.

2 other friends in the L.A. area have ukes too but have not learned to
play them.  I'm trying to convert them.  We'll see...

Rich
