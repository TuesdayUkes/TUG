<PRE>Thanks, Kevin, this is great stuff.

I'll second your recommendation, as well, on the Rob Mackillop books.
&#8203;Besides the two Fingerstyle Studies, I've also got his *20 Spanish Baroque
Pieces*, *The Bach Uke Book*, and his *20 Celtic Fingerstyle Uke Tunes *books.
The Bach book has 19 pieces (rather than his usual 20), 17 of which are
duets arranged for ukulele (re-entrant tuning, of course, like all of his
stuff) and either baritone uke or guitar.  The music that comes with the
book is Rob on a Sutherland tenor ukulele accompanied by Gordon Ferries on
an original Panormo guitar (ca. 1830).  Great stuff!  I'd recommend
anything from Rob to anyone who is serious about improving their
fingerstyle skills.

James Hill has a new book out, *Duets for One*, which continues on the
theme of his *The Ukulele Way *(i.e., playing melody, harmony and rhythm on
one instrument); it's also specifically arranged for re-entrant tuning.

Jonathan Lewis has some great fingerstyle stuff, also, and quite
affordable.  He's also a big campanella guy and re-entrant tuning
advocate.  You can download his free guide to campanella fingerstyle uke
from his website (see below).  He also has a small catalog of fingerstyle
books for sale for practically nothing, as well as a lot of one-off
things.  For example, his Celtic Tunes for Campanella Ukulele has 40 pieces
(plus 6 bonus pieces); each of the 40 comes with two .pdfs (one with
notation and tablature, the other with just tab), an MP3 of the tune and a
GuitarPro6 file.  So, 80 .pdfs, 40 MP3s and 40 GP6 files, all for $19!

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://robmackillop.net/ukulele/">https://robmackillop.net/ukulele/</A>) He&#8217;s a big proponent of campanella
</I>&gt;<i> style - so this is really much better with a high-g uke. The studies are
</I>&gt;<i> really interesting and well-graded. This is 4 finger (p-i-m-a) fingerstyle
</I>&gt;<i> - which is a little different than Aaron&#8217;s 3-finger (p-i-m) approach. Rob
</I>&gt;<i> also has a follow-on  - 20 Progressive Fingerstyle Studies for Uke. His
</I>&gt;<i> book are all published by Mel Bay - so you can get them from Amazon, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> He has several really good repertoire books  - and even a book of songs for
