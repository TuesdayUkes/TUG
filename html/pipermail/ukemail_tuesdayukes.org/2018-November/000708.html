<PRE> Hello all...When I followed the link to order the shirt it popped up in the green color.&#160; But they offer 5 different colors.&#160; What color are we proposing, or are we going to mix it up regarding colors but keep the same pattern?
Personally I'd vote we all do the red one, but I don't have a huge preference.... Just want some guidance.&#160;
Thanks!
Marty

     Here's what's up for the next TUG meeting Tuesday &lt;Date&gt; - Hancock Center      
      We'll be meeting (mostly) in Room 5 - (The big room&#160;downstairs)  
JD has suggested that we get some matching shirts for the open mic at the AUS Xmas party - and he's found some good ones on Amazon -&#160;<A HREF="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MFAZX99/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MFAZX99/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</A>
Take a look and we'll finalize at the next meeting and get them ordered.&#160;
We've been invited to St John's Library on Tues Dec 18 to play some Xmas tunes for their library Xmas party. It's at 5:00 - so whoever can make it then - we'll do a few tunes - and maybe wear our new Xmas shirts. And for that - we've got an XMAS song list that we'll go over at the next meeting. I've attached the PDF - and I'll bring some printouts.&#160; 
Marty, David and I went to the Brewotrium after TUG last night &#160;- and brought in our ukes and jammed a little. We were worried they would throw us out - bbut they bought us beers - and told us to come back. So, we'll plan a beer-themed song list for sometime in the New Year.&#160;
