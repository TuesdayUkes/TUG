<PRE>I've mentioned this to folks in our meetings - but for anyone who missed that - we're (loosely) organizing a group of folks to do singalongs for folks in assisted living, alzheimer care, nursing care, etc - we're calling the group Senior Sing. We'll have standard song books &#160;- one for now - and each singalong will be about a dozen songs. You can play the uke and sing, just play the uke, just sing, play a kazoo, play the shakers, play a ZED chord, fake the whole thing - the more folks we have at a singalong - the more participation we get from the audience &#160;- and the key to this is participation.&#160;

Our first rehearsal will be&#160;Sunday, January 12 - 12:30-2:30 at the Brewtorium. &#160;We'll rehearse once a month - though if we're playing a lot we may knock that down to &quot;when we need to rehearse&quot;.

We'll have a mailing list - which is how we'll annouce most of our events. We'll also list them on the&#160;TUG web site calendar&#160;- just type &quot;Senior Sing&quot; in the search bar and you should see all the upcoming events.&#160;

If you're interested, you don't need to come to every event, any level of participation will be welcome.&#160;

We've got a&#160;summary of Senior Sing&#160;on the web site.&#160;

We'll have mailing list &#160;sign up sheets at our weekly meeting - and you can also just reply to this email and say - sign me up - if you'd like to get &#160;on the mailing list.&#160;

Thanks!
