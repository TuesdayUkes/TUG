<PRE>We have a little ukulele polka band - we play ensemble pieces with mutliple parts. The instrumentation is generally Uke 1, Uke 2, Baritone, and Bass - and sometimes rhythm (chords). We're looking for a couple of folks to join the band in the Uke 2 part and possiblty in the rhythym part.&#160;

You can see a video of us on our web site -&#160;<A HREF="http://oompah-ukes.org/">http://oompah-ukes.org/</A>

This requires some sight reading ability - notation and/or TABs. We have a repertoire of about 8 songs - and we're adding a few new ones this year. Rehersals are every-other Saturday at 10:30am, we have members in Austin, Round Rock, and Georgetown, so we move the rehearsals around between people's houses. We've played for Marbrige Ranch Rehab, Close Friends Memory Care, some open mics, and in August we do a Uke-focused show in Rockdale - the Ukestravaganza - which is pretty fun. &#160;We want to expand our performances this year to include more independent living/senior care facilities. &#160;We're adding in a few non-polka tunes so we can have several sets with some variety in them.&#160;

Attached is a sample tune - In Heaven There is No Beer. These are the materials we generate for each tune - the parts with notation and tab, an MP3 of the complete tune, and an AVID Scorch file which can be used with the Scorch program to do a play-along for practice (<A HREF="https://www.avid.com/products/avid-scorch">https://www.avid.com/products/avid-scorch</A>)

There is a fair amount of practice required, and you won't dazzle anyone with your masterful solo rendition of the uke 2 part of Lichensteiner Polka (anyone else anyway - WE would be dazzled) - but if you're interested in working out both your left and right hands, and developing your sight-reading skills - or you just like polka - this might be something you'd enjoy.&#160;

If you're interested email me and we'll get you to one of our rehearsals and you can check it out.&#160;

Thanks&#160;

Kevin
