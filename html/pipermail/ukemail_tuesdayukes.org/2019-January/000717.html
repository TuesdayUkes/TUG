<PRE>Here's what's up for the next TUG meeting Tuesday January 8- Hancock Center

We'll be meeting (mostly) in Room 5 - (The big room&#160;downstairs)

Thanks to everyone who came out for he&#160;Uke-Along on New Year's Day - that was a lot of fun.&#160;

Attached is a the first pass at the song book for the next couple of months - it's unfinished - so bring in any songs you'd like to add and we'll put them in the&#160;list.&#160;
Also attached is our TUG PUB book - these are pub songs for the post-TUG Brewtorium meeting. (For folks how haven't made it - we've started meeting at the Brewtorium (<A HREF="http://thebrewtorium.com/">http://thebrewtorium.com/</A>) after the TUG meeting &#160;- 8:45 or so - for a beer and more playing/singing. On recent vistits they even have given us discounts on beers). The TUG PUB book is a set of pub/drinking songs. &#160;We'll be working these into the weekly schedule.&#160;
And - lastly - we've got the first draft of our Singalong Book - these are songs we'll work up as singalongs for when we play somewhere. There's about 20 songs - so we can pick and choose and have some variety for wherever we play. We'll also work these in as we go.&#160;

All these books are also available on the web site -&#160;<A HREF="../../../../www.tuesdayukes.org/index.html">http://tuesdayukes.org/</A>
