<PRE>Here's what's up for the next TUG meeting Tuesday, July 16 - &#160;Hancock Center. The weekly song PDF is attached. Also an OnSong archive file (for folks who are using OnSong).&#160;

Anyone interested in playing for the Lamar Senior Center Ice Cream Social ( Tuesday July 23 - 1:00-2:30) - please let me know and I'll send you the song sheets. This is kind of a sing-along - we'll have lyric sheets for the audience - and we'll play from paper/iPads. There are about a dozen tunes in the song list.&#160;

We have 21 songs in the Q3 book - let me know if there's anything you'd like to have the group play - we'll add it to the book.&#160;

We'll be meeting (mostly) in Room 5 - (The big room&#160;downstairs)
