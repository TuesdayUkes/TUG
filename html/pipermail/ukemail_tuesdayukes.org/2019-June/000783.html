<PRE>Next Tuesday - July 2 - we'll be meeting at the Central Market at 4100 North Lamar for our July UkeAlong. Bring a music stand - if you have one. We'll have loaner ukes, and percussion, and printed song sheets - so invite your uke-curious friends and neighbors. Attached is the errata sheet for Down On the Corner - we'll also have printed song sheets with the correct (hopefully) lyrics.&#160;

Our next regular TUG meeting is Tuesday July 9 - Hancock Center
We're starting a new set of songs - and we'll have a new set of songs on our weekly list - see below (and attached).&#160;

Also - the list of songs we have (so far) for Q319 is listed at the bottom here - if you have any songs you'd like to see added let me know and I'll try to find it and get it on the list.&#160;


We'll be meeting (mostly) in Room 5 - (The big room&#160;downstairs)
