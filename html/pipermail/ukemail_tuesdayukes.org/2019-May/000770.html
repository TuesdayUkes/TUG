Dear Kevin,
&#160;
This Sunday afternoon is going to be extra special.

ACG's brilliant Performance Engagement Artist, Joseph Palmer, will be giving a free concert at the gorgeous Central Public Library downtown. Joseph's exuberant playing, his ability to draw in audiences of all ages, and his gift for storytelling make him one of the most inspiring artists we know.

This concert is especially meaningful for all of us at ACG because it will be celebrating the life of Javier Ni&#241;o and the creation of a new scholarship fund created in his name. &#160;

Javier, or &quot;Javi&quot; as everyone called him, was a graduate of McCallum High School, and a freshman studying computer science at St. Edward's University. We first met Javi when he joined the guitar program at Eastside Memorial High School. He went on to study with Jeremy Osborne and later with Joseph Palmer, eventually winning an audition that allowed him to transfer to McCallum Fine Arts Academy as a guitar major.

Jeremy Osborne fondly remembers Javi's dedication to guitar:

&quot;We were able to surround Javi with resources to unlock his potential, and it didn't take long for him to begin soaking up everything we were giving him. He gave himself over to the community of guitarists he was part of, and the community in turn gave everything to him.&quot;

We established the Javier Ni&#241;o Memorial Scholarship Fund to honor the life of this talented young man who brought joy through beauty and kindness to so many people. Click here to learn more.

The McCallum High School Guitar Quartet - of which Javi was a member - will open the concert and then Joseph Palmer will take us all away.
&#160;
- The ACG Team&#160;
