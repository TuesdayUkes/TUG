<PRE>Hey folks,Just wanted to say a few words to the group as I could not remember if I had sent out anything aside from the card and note sent to Kevin's family. In case I hadn't or the email never went through, I did learn of his passing about four days after in an email from Raj and Marty. Even after these few weeks, it's still hard to realize he is no longer with us. I had last spoken with him in Feb after the AUS meeting when some of you performed at open mike.&#160; Then again at the coffee house event. Mentioned to him that I had been away since last Oct, due to some family obligations and that maybe I'd be able to join some of group events in the future.Kevin was the heart and soul of the TUG group. I remember back in the early days joining the group as a beginner, 3 months playing. Soon after we lost our space at Kevin Carrol's place and Kevin set up everything for us in the basement of the Hancock rec center. A tiny room, a storage space really, for our then tiny group with big enthusiasm. In the first few years of meetings before the website, we barely broke more than 7&#160;people. But there were the die-hard faithfuls, Kevin,Marty, David, me and later JD. I kinda thought of us as the 5 uketeers. One of the fondest memories I&#160; have is&#160; of us at the Brewtorium singing&#160; &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; with David on the harmonica. That was such a sweet tune the way we did it, and it would hush the usually noisey game night crowd at the pub whenever we sang it. Although Kevin could be a bit reserved, his collection of Hawaiian shirts always hinted otherwise. He was the go to guy when I had some awful finger twisting cord, in seconds Kevin would give me 2 or 3 easier alternative ways to play it. In 2019 it was nice to see the group literally triple in size after he put up the website. For us members old or new, Kevin will always be the spirit of the group. My hope is that we think of him now and then when we are playing our ukes and are trying to find that nicer chord.Good thoughts and prayers to his family and friends.&#160;RichSent via the Samsung Galaxy Express 3, an AT&amp;T 4G LTE smartphone
