<PRE>Only last year I was introduced to the ukulele.  With help of a remarkable community of players, I've grown to appreciate the influence that this socially active little instrument can have.  I was so moved by the appeal of the ukulele that, in planning our annual trip from Massachusetts to south Texas, my wife and I decided to visit as many ukulele groups, players and communities as we could in 22 days.  I think we had a nice sampling of what ukulele communities can look like.  Recurring themes were the social aspect, the appreciation of music and the genuine joy &amp; happiness that the ukulele brings to a group.  This is how I had the great fortune to meet and get to know a little bit about Kevin Jolly.  

Having met and played with Kevin, I am honored to have shared time with him and see how he used the power of the ukulele to build a musical community, foster the goodness of shared music and manifest inclusion in his teaching style.  I watched how, with great ease, he offered goodwill to students and audiences of ukulele music.  Where one might see his effort as a service to a niche population, they might not see that his selfless gift crossed over time and place.  He built musical confidence individually and collectively as he played and and we listened.  As the music poured out of Kevin, friendships were bound and thrived in his bigger-than-life attitude and his sweet song.

As those who knew Kevin can appreciate, his music wasn't restricted to traditional musical venues.  When we first met, I spied Kevin with his five ukuleles in a custom carrier and his A/V cart in a senior living center.  This man was a super spreader of the most infectious music and got my foot tapping at the drop of hat.  I was lucky to hear Kevin field requests (while not busking) from patrons of a restaurant and pub.   A wizened Irish woman was wheeled over by her family to hear &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; and her eyes beamed in hearing Kevin's beautiful rendition.   Likewise a young Aussie man,  on walk about, was thrilled to have a version and several choruses of Waltzing Matilda played for his date out on the town.  

Both my wife and I are saddened to think that we will not play together again on this plane. I will say a prayer for Kevin and think of his silence as only the rests.  Kevin, you are now the music between the notes.  

My sincere condolences to Kevin's family, his friends, Tuesday Ukulele Group, The Austin Ukulele Society, and the Greater Austin Music Community where Kevin introduced and promoted the joy of music.  A Gentleman of solid tone and rhythm, he made sweet music sweeter.

Aloha,
Jonathan Gottsche &amp; Shelley Parker
</PRE>
