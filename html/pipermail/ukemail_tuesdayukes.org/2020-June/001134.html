<PRE>Hi Friends -

I'm hearing of Kevin Jolly's passing for the first time this
evening through these emails. My sincerest condolences to you all and to
his family. Kevin was one of the most kind, inclusive and encouraging souls
I met in the uke circles. It seemed as though anything he grasped, he was
happy to share. And, he never needed the limelight...rather, he wanted to
see everyone else shine along. I miss the early garage days and everything
he worked to create. He never minded us going back through songs over and
over again and laughing through who would bring their *everything* to songs
from yesteryears. May those closest to him find comfort and peace in the
days, weeks, and months ahead.

A lot of people say you can't cry while playing a ukulele. I assure you
that they can handle a bucket of tears. And, all the memories, too.

Deanna

&gt;<i> Thanks so much for sharing that Jon.

</I>&gt;<i> I just heard the news this evening and am gutted. I&#8217;ve never known a
</I>&gt;<i> kinder, more inclusive and generous person. From day one Kevin made me feel
</I>&gt;<i> part of a community, encouraged my playing and singing and harmonizing and
</I>&gt;<i> always made it feel like I was doing him the favor. He was a great uke
</I>&gt;<i> player and a beautiful voice and was as humble about both those attributes
</I>&gt;<i> as he was his leadership of our community. I feel like he always sought to
</I>&gt;<i> make everyone feel comfortable and feel heard and ran TUG as a benevolent
</I>&gt;<i> democracy even though he did 100% of the work :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve spent the evening cueing up and listening to some of my favorite
</I>&gt;<i> Kevin faves including &#8220;Shady Grove&#8221;, &#8220;Dirty Old Town&#8221; &#8220;City of New Orleans&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> and of course &#8220;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I miss and will miss our friend Kevin and all the joy and music and
</I>&gt;<i> community and generosity he brought to my life. Every uke tune I&#8217;ll ever
</I>&gt;<i> play will partly be to his credit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here&#8217;s to one of the best men I was lucky enough to know.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#65279;Only last year I was introduced to the ukulele.  With help of a
</I>&gt;<i> remarkable community of players, I've grown to appreciate the influence
</I>&gt;<i> that this socially active little instrument can have.  I was so moved by
</I>&gt;<i> the appeal of the ukulele that, in planning our annual trip from
</I>&gt;<i> Massachusetts to south Texas, my wife and I decided to visit as many
</I>&gt;<i> ukulele groups, players and communities as we could in 22 days.  I think we
</I>&gt;<i> had a nice sampling of what ukulele communities can look like.  Recurring
</I>&gt;<i> themes were the social aspect, the appreciation of music and the genuine
</I>&gt;<i> joy &amp; happiness that the ukulele brings to a group.  This is how I had the
</I>&gt;<i> great fortune to meet and get to know a little bit about Kevin Jolly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Having met and played with Kevin, I am honored to have shared time with
</I>&gt;<i> him and see how he used the power of the ukulele to build a musical
</I>&gt;<i> community, foster the goodness of shared music and manifest inclusion in
</I>&gt;<i> his teaching style.  I watched how, with great ease, he offered goodwill to
</I>&gt;<i> students and audiences of ukulele music.  Where one might see his effort as
</I>&gt;<i> a service to a niche population, they might not see that his selfless gift
</I>&gt;<i> crossed over time and place.  He built musical confidence individually and
</I>&gt;<i> collectively as he played and and we listened.  As the music poured out of
</I>&gt;<i> Kevin, friendships were bound and thrived in his bigger-than-life attitude
</I>&gt;<i> and his sweet song.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As those who knew Kevin can appreciate, his music wasn't restricted to
</I>&gt;<i> traditional musical venues.  When we first met, I spied Kevin with his five
</I>&gt;<i> ukuleles in a custom carrier and his A/V cart in a senior living center.
</I>&gt;<i> This man was a super spreader of the most infectious music and got my foot
</I>&gt;<i> tapping at the drop of hat.  I was lucky to hear Kevin field requests
</I>&gt;<i> (while not busking) from patrons of a restaurant and pub.   A wizened Irish
</I>&gt;<i> woman was wheeled over by her family to hear &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; and her eyes
</I>&gt;<i> beamed in hearing Kevin's beautiful rendition.   Likewise a young Aussie
</I>&gt;<i> man,  on walk about, was thrilled to have a version and several choruses of
</I>&gt;<i> Waltzing Matilda played for his date out on the town.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Both my wife and I are saddened to think that we will not play together
</I>&gt;<i> again on this plane. I will say a prayer for Kevin and think of his silence
</I>&gt;<i> as only the rests.  Kevin, you are now the music between the notes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My sincere condolences to Kevin's family, his friends, Tuesday Ukulele
</I>&gt;<i> Group, The Austin Ukulele Society, and the Greater Austin Music Community
</I>&gt;<i> where Kevin introduced and promoted the joy of music.  A Gentleman of solid
</I>&gt;<i> tone and rhythm, he made sweet music sweeter.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Aloha,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jonathan Gottsche &amp; Shelley Parker
