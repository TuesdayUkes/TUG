 Hi, friends!&#160;
We're excited for you to participate in Austin Ukulele Society's June meeting collaborative video! Please review the notes below carefully and let us know if you have any questions. :)

We invite you to make either an audio or video recording of yourself playing &quot;Make You Feel My Love&quot; along with Bob.&#160; Our great friend from&#160;TUG, Marty Porter, will once again compile everyone's contributions into a collaborative video that we'll publish on our YouTube channel and share on Facebook and our website.&#160;

Below are the details:
   
   - Grab a copy of Bob's rendition of &quot;Make You Feel My Love&quot; from the shared folder below (it's named &quot;Make_You_Feel_PLAY_ALONG.mp4&quot;):&#160;<A HREF="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qkHUUViZUo892SHragafVwA2_pInx-BI.&#160;">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qkHUUViZUo892SHragafVwA2_pInx-BI.&#160;</A>
   - The play along video file has a click/drum track throughout to make it easy to follow the beat, a visual countdown to help you start at the right time, another visual countdown to tell you where to slow down at the end, and the slides from the meeting presentation, including the chords and lyrics.
   - Record audio or video of yourself playing along.&#160;Though our strong preference is that you record yourself on the whole song,&#160;it's also okay if it's just a section of the song (if you prefer it) - but please record for at least a minute.&#160;Recording yourself on the whole song increases the likelihood that you'll be in the final video.&#160;If you record part of the song only, please specify the section of the song.&#160;&#160;
   - Please only record your part of the audio and&#160;not&#160;Bob's, by listening to Bob's through earbuds or headset.
   - Syncing new clips with Bob's rendition will be easier if the files are similarly formatted. Bob's file is an MP4 file with a resolution of 1080p (1920x1080) at 30 frames per second. The audio is 48 kHz stereo. &#160; If you don't have the capability to format the file this way, then just do the best you can and we'll see if we can use it.&#160; If you do only audio, please submit it as an mp3.
   - As much as you can, try to have yourself centered in the frame (by the way, landscape is preferred over portrait).&#160;
   - Choose a quiet enough place and try to place yourself at a suitable&#160;proximity to the mic. Please take a listen to your video after you're done to see if you hear yourself clearly; this will help us hear you in the compilation. :)
Please name your file &quot;Lastname_Firstname -&#160;full&#160;(or)&#160;partial.mp4&quot;&#160;(or mp3 for audio).&#160; Upload your file on Marty's shared Google Drive here:&#160;<A HREF="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qkHUUViZUo892SHragafVwA2_pInx-BI">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qkHUUViZUo892SHragafVwA2_pInx-BI</A>
Please submit your files by Sunday, June 28th, at 8pm - and when you upload it, please send a note to me (<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">austinukes at gmail.com</A>) and copy Marty (<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">mlp at flash.net</A>).&#160;
If you have any questions, please let us know. :)
Thanks, friends!
Best,Jen (and Marty and Bob!)--
