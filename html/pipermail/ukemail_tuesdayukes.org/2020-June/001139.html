<PRE>We are shocked and very sad to hear this news.  Deepest condolences to
Karen and Don.  Kevin was so passionate about the uke and music.  TUG was
such a fun group, he would always let others go first but came prepared
with something in case others didn't have anything.  I always came away
with learning something new.

I will miss him.

Raj and Sally

</I>&gt;<i> Fellow Friends of Kevin (please pass along):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I write to update you all on evolving plans to remember our beloved friend
</I>&gt;<i> and uniter and help us deal with the grief.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Karen and Don are holding up, as she put it: 'Kevin prepared me well by
</I>&gt;<i> being willing to discuss all logical life possibilities, usually jokingly,
</I>&gt;<i> so I knew exactly what he wanted and have had no qualms about what to do.'
</I>&gt;<i> Don is very grateful that he moved back to Austin from the east coast in
</I>&gt;<i> 2019 and he and Kevin had much of the last year to reforge their bond.
</I>&gt;<i> They both want to share and hear Kevin stories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Karen is convinced that Kevin really departed this earth when the massive
</I>&gt;<i> heart attack happened on Saturday afternoon.  They kept some of his
</I>&gt;<i> functions technically alive for another 27 hours, but he was already gone.
</I>&gt;<i> We all know he would have hated lingering in hospital with no prospect of
</I>&gt;<i> returning to full life.  Perhaps a sudden and quick end was the way it had
</I>&gt;<i> to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that many of you are struggling with his sudden departure, just
</I>&gt;<i> like me.  He can't be gone.  I've been trying to stop weeping with almost
</I>&gt;<i> every trigger, just like I am now. ... I think most of us will only find
</I>&gt;<i> solace through remembering and sharing.  So here is what is being planned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Years ago Kevin made me pledge I would write his obituary, which I agreed
</I>&gt;<i> to do only if he promised to write mine.  I lost.  With Karen and Don's
</I>&gt;<i> help -- and we welcome any direct communications with ideas and
</I>&gt;<i> unknown-to-me facts that might be relevant -- a proper obituary will be
</I>&gt;<i> published next week in Austin and San Antonio papers.  It will be too long,
</I>&gt;<i> but not near long enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Karen and Don want very much to have a proper wake, up close and rubbing
</I>&gt;<i> elbows, swilling beer, retelling Kevin stories, show and telling, eating
</I>&gt;<i> good food.  But that can't happen until the pandemic is dealt with.  When
</I>&gt;<i> conditions allow, unknown months from now, we will do just that and hold a
</I>&gt;<i> wake he would have approved of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime two more timely things are in the works.  There will be a
</I>&gt;<i> Kevin Jolly Zoom Wake on Thursday, June 25th, 4:30pm until it ends.
</I>&gt;<i> Details early next week, but be thinking about what you might share. We can
</I>&gt;<i> anticipate dozens of participants, so each of us will have to settle on a
</I>&gt;<i> particular story to share or song to sing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The all-too-inadequate Zoom Wake will be followed by a website that will
</I>&gt;<i> allow each of us to add stories, pictures, videos, etc. at greater length.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know yet when this will happen, but sooner than later.  More
</I>&gt;<i> details next week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yours in the Kevo cause, Stevo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS:  Some of you know that Kevin was the cook in the family - planned the
</I>&gt;<i> meals, bought (exactly) what was needed, and did all the cooking (except
</I>&gt;<i> some baking).  Kevin even made Karen lunches to take to work, organized and
</I>&gt;<i> sitting on the designated refrigerator shelf awaiting her to grab it on the
</I>&gt;<i> way out the door.  Don is concerned that now she isn't eating much.  We
</I>&gt;<i> three talked about this and Karen laughingly revealed that one of the
</I>&gt;<i> things that she and Kevin joked about was what each of them would do if the
</I>&gt;<i> other passed first.  Kevin was worried that he wouldn't be able to sleep
</I>&gt;<i> without the many night-owl sounds she made - doing dishes, playing harp,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. -- after he went to bed, early as usual.  Karen was worried that until
</I>&gt;<i> she learned to cook again she would only be eating oatmeal.   So, if a few
</I>&gt;<i> of you in the Austin area were able to drop off a small prepared dinner or
</I>&gt;<i> lunch or two now and again, I think Karen would eat better.
