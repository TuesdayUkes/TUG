<PRE> Hi, Kevin,
Many thanks to you, Paul, Marty and Walter.
Hello, All!

 Hey Folks --
I hope everyone's doing well. Paul,&#160;Marty, Walter and I have been messing around with various ways for us to&#160;all play together - while remaining separate - and nothing has really worked out to replicate the group experience. &#160;We're going to try an online open mic using Zoom - which looks promising - we'll send out details once we get it figured out.&#160;
As for our weekly songs - I've cut the list down a little -&#160;and over the next couple of days I'll put together a video play-along - it's not ideal - but it's something. I'll update everyone when it's online.&#160;
I'm going to try to spend some time on the web site adding the various play-along/singalong videos we're working on - so they will all be in one place. I'll also try to pull together a big PDF of TUG songs &#160;- and post that up there as well.&#160;
If you have a video or audio recording you'd like to share with the group &#160;- send it out to <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">ukemail at tuesdayukes.org</A>&#160;- we can all use a little ukulele&#160;uplifting.&#160;
Here's the songs this week.&#160;

|<i> Title | Artist | Key | Capo |
</I>|<i> Home on the Range | Gene Autry | C |  |
</I>|<i> Announcements |  | C |  |
</I>|<i> Dirty Old Town | Ewan McColl, 1949 | D |  |
</I>|<i> LA Freeway | Guy Clark - 1972 | A |  |
</I>|<i> Particle Man | They Might be Giants - 1990 | C |  |
</I>|<i> Waltzing with Bears | Theodor Seuss Geisel - and others | G |  |
</I>|<i> Shimmy Like My Sister Kate | Armand J. Piron - 1922 | G |  |
</I>


Take care
Kevin
