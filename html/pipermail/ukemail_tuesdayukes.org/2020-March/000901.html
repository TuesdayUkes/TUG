<PRE>The bass line comes from me! From my normal ukulele! I play some half-baked
bass line, and then electronically shift it down. In most of these videos I
shifted down one octave, but in this case I dropped it two octaves.

I record the audio with Audacity (an open source audio program) through a
Samson CO1u Pro  <A HREF="http://amzn.to/2d6Pa6F">http://amzn.to/2d6Pa6F</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F2d6Pa6F&amp;v=01Eezdu7OGw&amp;redir_token=wdSgb9DezjuBqf5JmgkTmoQ2-IJ8MTU4NDk3MjUyNUAxNTg0ODg2MTI1&amp;event=video_description">https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F2d6Pa6F&amp;v=01Eezdu7OGw&amp;redir_token=wdSgb9DezjuBqf5JmgkTmoQ2-IJ8MTU4NDk3MjUyNUAxNTg0ODg2MTI1&amp;event=video_description</A>&gt;.
I record each part separately, and I'm usually listening to the parts I
previously recorded (so the new part will be synchronized). In some videos,
I'm not wearing headphones, and that is always because the video
corresponds to the first part I recorded. For Red House, I was listening to
the Jimi Hendrix recording
<A HREF="https://open.spotify.com/track/3XxBSvDZKH5YvZZjTpn6eR?si=AAry1qAqRyi1l7gXc7Q_Rw.">https://open.spotify.com/track/3XxBSvDZKH5YvZZjTpn6eR?si=AAry1qAqRyi1l7gXc7Q_Rw.</A>
You can actually play my video over that recording and they will stay
synchronized.

My formula for the audio is pretty simple: record a track, run noise
reduction, compression (mostly because it normalizes the volume), and then
add a little reverb (I have those steps stored as a macro, so it's a
one-click operation). For the bass, I do all that prior to shifting the
pitch down. I usually pan the bass 40% left and the strumming 40% right
(which is usually also the vocal), and leave any solo part in the middle.
Once I have a stack of tracks I like, I export that as an .mp3. Red House
is the only video I've done with a separate vocal recording -- in all the
others one of the tracks has me singing and playing. I also added more
reverb to the Red House vocal compared to my normal formula.

For some of the audio tracks, I also record video using a cheap web cam and
the Windows 10 camera app (which does not seem to have an exposure
control). I then import all the videos and the one .mp3 into Kdenlive (an
open source video editor). Kdenlive has a feature to align the tracks based
on the audio, and it often works pretty well. I have a lot to learn about
video editing, but that's not where my interest lies, so I'm not likely to
get any better.

For all the videos I've posted recently, I have liberally taken advantage
of the ability to edit out mistakes. If you flub a segment, you can keep
most of it and just replace the bad part pretty easily.

Just for fun, the attachment is a version of the audio with distortion
added to kind of emulate the Hendrix sound.
