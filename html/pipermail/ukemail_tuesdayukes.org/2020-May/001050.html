<PRE>Mark your calendars

Wednesday, May 27 at 7:00pm - Del Rey is going to host a Zoom workshop for TUG (and Lamar and Baca).

If you're not familiar with Del she is an amazing blues ukulele (and guitar) player and teacher. Check out her web site -&#160;

<A HREF="https://delreyplays.com/">https://delreyplays.com/</A>

and/or &#160;- check out this extensive play list -&#160;<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3G6UTOZzczUyI6MDif3dVg47_D3uxYKW">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3G6UTOZzczUyI6MDif3dVg47_D3uxYKW</A>

For our workshop we'll be learning CC Rider - a great blues tune first recorded by Ma Rainey in 1924. Del will lead us through a rhythm (strumming) part, a melody part, and turnarounds - and we'll end up with a complete ensemble piece - for when we're all back together again. Del does a great job of breaking a tune down into parts which are accessible for folks with lots of different skill levels - so there will be something for everyone.&#160;

There will be no charge for the workshop &#160;- but we are asking folks who are so inclined to leave a tip (via PayPal) &#160;and/or buy a CD (digital or physical). We'll have full details on that as the day gets here.&#160;

We'd like folks to RSVP before Friday, May 22. Just let us know if you plan to attend.

So, how will this work?

Del is going to put together a You Tube video of the CC Rider lesson - and she'll make it available to us a week before the workshop. We'll send the link to the video to everyone who RSVP's and then we'll individually take a look at that - practice, etc. On Wednesday, May 27 we'll meet on Zoom with Del, she'll take us through the material in person - and answer any questions, etc.&#160;

We've set this up for the greater TUG family - so please don't share it outside of the TUG, Lamar, or Baca groups.&#160;

To RSVP just reply to this email and let us know you want to attend.&#160;

Uke On!
