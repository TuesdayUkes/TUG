 Since my emails have not been reaching everybody for the past few months, I am resending the video index from our meetings going back to June. Each of these meetings has at least a few songs with music on the screen to make playing along easy. That's a lot of music, and there are some nice performances in there!
You can see all of our Zoom meetings at our Youtube channel. Most of those videos have an index in the description or in the comments section.<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl76XSHlx-AO04jsPbfP14Q/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl76XSHlx-AO04jsPbfP14Q/videos</A>

You can also browse PDF's for much of our music from the summer. Click on the song title to see the music and look for the &quot;download&quot; button on the right just above the music:<A HREF="https://github.com/TuesdayUkes/music/tree/master/PDFs/Summer%202020">https://github.com/TuesdayUkes/music/tree/master/PDFs/Summer%202020</A>
