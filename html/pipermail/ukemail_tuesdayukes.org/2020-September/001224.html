<PRE> Hey, TUG, Lamar, and Baca folks:
We're trying to get folks to contribute to the 'extras' part of the upcoming &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot; video by having them video themselves, their friends and families holding up lighters, candles, flashlights, etc.
Details are in Jen's message below.
In case you didn't get the original collaboration email the location to upload your contribution is:<A HREF="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H1cATSfcG8KYvlDdX7KkbCcfihW3kBRM?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H1cATSfcG8KYvlDdX7KkbCcfihW3kBRM?usp=sharing</A>

Hope y'all can send in some creative stuff!
Marty

 Hi, friends!
Marty had a fun idea to make the September power ballad collaborative video (&quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot;) even more creative, by having some interesting shots (stills or short videos) holding a lighter (a real or phone app one). Whether or not you're submitting a video of yourself performing the song along with Bob, you (and friends and family) are welcome to do this. Here are some instructions:   
   - still photos or up to 30 second videos would be great. Sound on the video is not going to be used, so it is unimportant.
   - any frame rate, quality level, etc. can be used.
   - any light source would be fine.&#160;
   - interesting locations, creative approaches, etc, are all welcome
   - please upload to the same area on the Google drive
   - we'll do our best to include what you send, but please understand that some photos or clips might not be used, due to time constraints of the song collaboration
Please let me know if you have any questions, and please stick to the September 27th 8pm 'deadline' if you can. :)
Thanks, friends!
-Jen, Bob and Marty

Hi, friends!&#160;
We're excited for you to participate in Austin Ukulele Society's September meeting collaborative video!&#160;Please review the notes below carefully and let us know if you have any questions.&#160;:)

We invite you to make either an audio or video recording of yourself playing &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot; along with Bob.&#160; Our great friend from&#160;TUG, Marty Porter, will once again compile everyone's contributions into a collaborative video that we'll publish on our YouTube channel and share on Facebook and our website.&#160;

Here are the details:
   
   - Grab a copy of Bob's rendition of &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot; from the shared folder below (it's named &quot;Cant_Fight_This_Feeling_AUS_PLAY_ALONG.mp4&quot;):&#160;<A HREF="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H1cATSfcG8KYvlDdX7KkbCcfihW3kBRM.&#160;">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H1cATSfcG8KYvlDdX7KkbCcfihW3kBRM.&#160;</A> The play along video includes:
   
   - A click/drum track throughout to make it easy to follow the beat.
   - A visual countdown to help you start off at the same time. There's another visual countdown at the end to signal the final strum.
   - The slides from the meeting presentation, to make it easy to follow the chords and lyrics.
   
   - Record audio or video of yourself playing along.&#160;Though our strong preference is that you record yourself on the whole song,&#160;it's also okay if it's just one verse/chorus (if you prefer it) - but please record for at least a minute.&#160;Recording yourself on the whole song increases the likelihood that you'll be in the final video.&#160;If you record part of the song only, please specify which part you record.&#160;&#160;
   - Please only record your part of the audio and&#160;not&#160;Bob's, by listening to Bob's through earbuds or headset.
   - As much as you can, try to have yourself centered in the frame (by the way, landscape is preferred over portrait).&#160;
   - Choose a quiet enough place and try to place yourself at a suitable&#160;proximity to the mic. Please take a listen to your recording after you're done to see if you hear yourself clearly; this will help us hear you in the compilation. :)
Please name your file &quot;Lastname_Firstname -&#160;full&#160;(or)&#160;partial.mp4&quot;&#160;(or mp3 for audio).&#160; Upload your file on Marty's shared Google Drive here:&#160;<A HREF="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H1cATSfcG8KYvlDdX7KkbCcfihW3kBRM">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H1cATSfcG8KYvlDdX7KkbCcfihW3kBRM</A>
Please submit your files by Sunday, September 27th, at 8pm - and when you upload it, please send a note to us (<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">austinukes at gmail.com</A>) and Marty (<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">mlp at flash.net</A>).&#160;
If you have any questions, please let us know. :)
Thanks, friends!
Best,Jen (and Marty and Bob!)
