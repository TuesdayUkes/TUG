<PRE>Dear TUG participants:

Hancock Recreation Center has reopened for in person activities without a
mask requirement.  Yay!  Marty Porter has checked with them and, barring
any unforeseen issues, the weekly TUG meeting is going to  return to
Hancock starting Tuesday, April 12.  (The April 5 meeting will still be a
Zoom meeting.)

We are planning on trying to continue to use Zoom at the weekly meeting so
that our out of town members  (this means you, Vany and Errol)  and our in
town members who can&#8217;t make it in person can continue to join us.  We have
the projector and screen that we inherited from Kevin Jolly, and should be
able to continue on Zoom if Hancock&#8217;s wifi connection will  cooperate.

The format will remain the same open mic format that we have been using
with the Zoom meetings.  To make this work, we will need you to send your
songs in a little earlier-three days instead of three minutes.  The goal
will be to gradually compile a new song book that we will be able to draw
from in the future.

The meetings at Hancock will be from 7pm to 8:30pm on Tuesdays.  Hancock is
located at 811 E. 41st St. in central Austin.  (Marty assures us that beer
will still be available at the Brewtorium after the meeting.)

Any questions? There should be more info at the April 5 meeting, or contact
Paul Butler (<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">c.paul.butler at gmail.com</A>) or Marty Porter <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">mlp at flash.net</A>).
Thanks and hope to see you there!!!
