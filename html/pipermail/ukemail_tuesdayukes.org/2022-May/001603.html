<PRE>Thanks...&#160; I actually didn't lose any sleep last night but just wanted to set the record straight!

Marty.

No apologies needed from me. &#160;You do more than your share to promote and organize our get-togethers. Also, I enjoyed the experience and I appreciated the way the Tuesday Ukes just rolled with the changed location.&#160;

Subject: [Ukemail] Missed an email

 &#160;

Hey everyone...&#160; thought I should let y'all know that apparently I'm the one responsible for all the confusion on the meeting last night.

 &#160;

I looked through my old emails and found an un-read one from April 29th where the Hancock center did inform me that they were to be closed this week.

 &#160;

Sorry, I just overlooked that email...&#160; I've had my same email address since 1994 and usually get about a hundred emails a day from some company or other I've done business with over the years.&#160; I look through my incoming mail for 'from' folks I know and don't read the vast majority of 'em so this is one that slipped through.

 &#160;

I apologize for the confusion,

 &#160;

Marty
