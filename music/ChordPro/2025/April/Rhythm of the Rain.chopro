*Intro:
[F] [Dm] [F] [C7] 

[F]Listen to the rhythm of the [Bb]falling rain
[F]Telling me just what a fool I've [C]been
I [F]wish that it would go and let me [Bb]cry in vain
And [F]let me be a[C]lone a[F]gain [C7] 

The [F]only girl I care about has [Bb]gone away
[F]Looking for a brand new [C]start
But [F]little does she know
That when she [Bb]left that day
[F]Along with her she [C]took my [F]heart	

[Bb]Rain please tell me now does [Am]that seem fair
For [Bb]her to steal my heart away when [F]she don't care
I [Dm]can't love another when my [Gm7]hearts some[C7]where far a[F]way [C] 

The [F]only girl I care about has [Bb]gone away
[F]Looking for a brand new [C]start
But [F]little does she know
That when she [Bb]left that day
A[F]long with her she [C]took my [F]heart

[Bb]Rain won't you tell her that I l[Am]ove her so
[Bb]Please ask the sun to set her [F]heart aglow
[Dm]Rain in her heart and let the [Gm7]love we [C7]knew start to [F]grow[C]
