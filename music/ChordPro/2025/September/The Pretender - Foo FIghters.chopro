{st: Foo Fighters}

(Intro)
[Am]Keep you in the dark
You know they [F#m7-5]all pret[Fmaj7]end
[Am]Keep you in the dark
And so it [F#m7-5]all beg[Fmaj7]an

(Verse 1)
[Am]  Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching i[D/F#]n... aga[F]in
[Am]  The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are [D/F#]at the ready
[F]Are you ready? [G]
[Am]  I'm finished making sense

Done pleading ignorance
That o[D/F#]ld, def[F]ense  [G]
[Am]  Spinning infinity, but

The wheel is spinning me
It's [D/F#]neverending, [F]neverending[G]
[D]Same old story

(Chorus)
[Am]What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another [D/F#]one of your plays?

You're the pretender
[F]What if I say that I'll never surrender?

[Am]What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another [D/F#]one of your plays?

You're the pretender
[F]What if I say that I'll never surrender?


(Verse 2)
[Am]  In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for s[D/F#]ale... oh, we[F]ll  [G]
[Am]  The page is out of print

We are not permanent
We're [D/F#]temporary, [F]temporary [G]
[D]Same old story


(Chorus)
[Am]What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another [D/F#]one of your plays?

You're the pretender
[F]What if I say that I'll never surrender?

[Am]What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another [D/F#]one of your plays?

You're the pretender
[F]What if I say that I'll never surrender? [D]

[A5] I'm the voice inside your head
[A5] You refuse to hear

[A5] I'm the enemy
[A5] I'm the hand that will take you down
[A5] Bring you to your knees
[A5] So who are you?
