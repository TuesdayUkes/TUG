(Verse 1)

Let it [E7]rain, [Edim7]let it pour, [E7]let it rain a [A7]whole lot more
'Cause [E7]I got them [E7]deep river [B7]blues   [B7]
[E7]Let the rain d[Edim7]rive right on, [E7]let the waves [A7]sweep along
'Cause [E7]I got them [B7]deep river [E]blues  [E]


(Verse 2)

[E7]My old gal's a [Edim7]good old pal, and [E7]she looks like a [A7]water fowl
When [E7]I get them [E7]deep river [B7]blues   [B7]
[E7]Ain't no one to [Edim7]cry for me, and the [E7]fish all go out [A7]on a spree
When [E7]I get them [B7]deep river [E]blues  [E]

(Verse 3)

[E7]Give me back [Edim7]my old boat, [E7]I'm gonna sail i[A7]f she'll float
'Cause [E7]I got them [E7]deep river [B7]blues   [B7]
[E7]I'm goin' back to [Edim7]Muscle Shoals, [E7]times are better [A7]there I'm told
'Cause [E7]I got them [B7]deep river [E]blues  [E]


(Verse 4)

[E7]Let it rain, [Edim7]let it pour, [E7]let it rain a [A7]whole lot more
'Cause [E7]I got them [E7]deep river [B7]blues   [B7]
[E7]Let the rain [Edim7]drive right on, [E7]let the waves [A7]sweep along
'Cause [E7]I got them [B7]deep river [E]blues  [E]

'Cause [E7]I got them [E7]deep river [B7]blues   [B7]
[E7]Now I'm gonna [Edim7]say goodbye, and [E7]if I sink, just [A7]let me die
'Cause [E7]I got them [B7]deep river [E]blues  [E]
