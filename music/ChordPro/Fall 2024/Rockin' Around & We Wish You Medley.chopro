[C]Rockin' around the Christmas tree, at the [G7]Christmas party hop.
[Dm7]Mistletoe [G7]hung where [Dm7]you can [G7]see; every [Dm7]couple [G7]wants to [C]stop.

[C]Rockin' around the Christmas tree; let the [G7]Christmas spirit ring.
[Dm7]Later we'll [G7]have some [Dm7]pumpkin [G7]pie, and we'll [Dm7]do some [G7]caro-[C]ling.

[F]You will get a sentimental [Em]feeling, when you hear;
[Am]Voices singing,"[C]let's be jolly; [D7(stop)]deck the halls with [G7(stop)]boughs of holly."

[C]Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a [G7]happy holiday.
[Dm7]Ev'ryone [G7]dancing [Dm7]merri[G7]ly, in the [Dm7]new old-[G7]fashioned [C]way.
