[C] Up this morning before the sun
Fixed me some coffee and a [G7] honey bun.

[C] Down by the lake side, just off the ramp,
All them people sleeping in their [G7] fishing camp

The [F] early birdie always [C] gets his worm
[F] Me I always get my [C] wish
[F] When you're talking 'bout that [C] five pound bass son
The [F] early worm, it gets the [G7] fish!

Verse 3:
[C] Jumped in my john boat; I stow my gear
I fire it up and when we're [G7] out in the clear
I [C] sail across that [C7] water, as [F] smooth as glass

Verse 4:
I [C] find the perfect spot, near some old dead trees
Back in a canyon where you [G7] can't feel no breeze
[C] I tie my [C7] lure. [F]  I make my cast
It's [G7] breakfast time you five pound [C] bass

The [F] early worm, it gets the [G7] fish!

Verse 5:
[C] That old sun is rising.  That water's clear
I watch my lure as it's [G7] flying through the air
[C] I see a ripple. [F] I hear a splash
[G7] Lord have mercy, it's a five pound [C] bass!

Spoken:
That's a five pound bass son
It's big as a new borne baby
Get those hoecakes ready
