[D]Take my [G]hand; come under [A]cover.

[Bm]Have I [G]doubt [A]when I'm a[Bm]lone?
[Bm]Love is a [G]ring,   the [A]tele[Bm]phone.
[Bm]Love is an [G]angel dis[A]guised as [Bm]lust,
[Bm]here in our [G]bed until the [A]morning [Bm]comes.

[G]Come on [A]now, try and [D]under[A]stand
the [Bm]way I [G]feel under your com[A]mand.

(Bridge)

With [D]love we [A]sleep; with [D]doubt the [A]vicious circle [Bm]turns and [A]burns.
[D]Without [A]you I cannot [Bm]live, [A]forgive [D]the yearning [A]burning.
I be[G]lieve [D]it's time, [G]too real to feel.
So [Bm]touch me now, [D]touch me now, [G]touch me [F#]now.


[Bm]Because [G]the night belongs to [A]lov-[Bm]ers.
[Bm]Because [G]the night belongs [A]to [Bm]us.
[Bm]Because [G]the night belongs to [A]lov-[Bm]ers.
[Bm]Because [G]the night belongs [A]to [Bm]us.

[Bm]Because [G]tonight there are two [A]lov-[Bm]ers.
[Bm]If we [G]believe in the night [A]we [Bm]trust
[Bm]Because [G]the night belongs to [A]lov-[Bm]ers.
[Bm]Because [G]the night belongs [A]to [Bm]us.
