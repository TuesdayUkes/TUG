Intro:
&bue: Ain't Gonna Rain No More
&bue: Traditional; adapted from a hit recording by Wendell Hall (1923)

[G] Oh, the night was dark and dreary, and the air was full of [D7] sleet;
An old man stood out in the cold, and his shoes were full of [G] feet [D7]

[G] It ain't gonna rain no more no more, It ain't gonna rain no [D7] more
How in the heck can I wash my neck, if it ain't gonna rain no [G] more [D7]

[G] We had a cat down on our farm, she ate a ball of [D7] yarn
[D7] When the little cats were born, they all had sweaters [G] on [D7]

[G] There ain't no bugs on me, there ain't no bugs on [D7] me
There may be bugs on some of you mugs, but there ain't no bugs on [G] me [D7]

[G] Well the butterfly flits on wings of gold, the June Bug wings of [D7] flame.
[D7] The bedbug has no wings at all, but he gets there just the [G] same. [D7]

Instrumental:
&bue: [G] There ain't no flies on me, there ain't no flies on [D7] me
&bue: There may be flies on some of you guys, but there ain't no flies on [G] me [D7]

[G] There ain't no flies on me, there ain't no flies on [D7] me
There may be flies on some of you guys, but there ain't no flies on [G] me [D7]

[G] We had a goat down on our farm, she ate up old tin [D7] cans
[D7] When the little goats were born, they came in Ford [G] sedans [D7]

[G] My uncle built a chim-n-ney, he built it up so [D7] high.
[D7] They had to tear it down again to let the moon go [G] by. [D7]

[G] Mosquito he fly high, and mosquito he fly [D7] low
[D7] If that mosquito lights on me, he ain't a-gonna fly no [G] mo' [D7]

[G] It ain't gonna rain no more no more, it ain't gonna rain no [D7] more
How in the heck can I wash my neck, if it ain't gonna rain no [G] more [D7]

Outro:
&bue: [G] It ain't gonna rain no more no more, It ain't gonna rain no [D7] more
&bue: How in the heck can I wash my neck, if it ain't gonna rain no [G] more [D7] [G]
