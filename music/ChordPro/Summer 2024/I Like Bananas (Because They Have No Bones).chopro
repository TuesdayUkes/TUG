"You [D7] never seem to [A7] show the [D7] fruit we all love [A7] so
[D7] That's why business hasnâ€™t been the [G] same [G7]

Be- [F] cause they [G7] have no [C] bones [G7]

[C] Don't give me tomatoes
[D7] Can't stand ice cream cones
[G7] I like bananas
Be- [F] cause they [G7] have no [C] bones [G7]
 
[Bridge 1]
No [F] matter where I go [G7]
With [C] Susie, May, or [A7] Anna
I [D7] want the world to know
I [G7] must have my [D7] banana [G7]

[C] Cabbages and onions
[D7] Hurt my singing tones
[G7] I like bananas
Be- [F] cause they [G7] have no [C] bones [G7]

Man, there's [F] something in bananas [G7]

[Verse 4]
