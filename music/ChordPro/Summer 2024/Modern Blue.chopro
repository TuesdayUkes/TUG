I [Am]walked the streets of Paris in the [F]pouring[C] rain [Am]    [Am]    [F]    [C]
I [Am]flew across an island in the [F]northern[C] sea  [Am]    [Am]    [F]    [C]
And I [Am]ended up in Memphis, [F]Tenne[C]ssee

(Chorus)
I keep my [F]head down
I keep my [G]eyes on you
Its a b[Am(Hold)]ig wide world
With a m[F(Hold)]illion shades of [E7(Hold)]modern    [Am]blue [Am]      [F]    [C]

[Am] [Am]  [F]   [C]

And it [Am]feels so good but its [F]never gonna [C]last  [Am]    [Am]    [F]   [C]
[Am]Everything I had is [F]twice what I [C]knew   [Am]     [Am]    [F]    [C]
But I [Am]dont have nothin if I [F]don't have [C]you

So Iâ€™m [Am]headin back to Memphis on the [F]midnight [C]train
