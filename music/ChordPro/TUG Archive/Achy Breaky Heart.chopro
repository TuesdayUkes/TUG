{title:Achy Breaky Heart}
{key:G}

(Verse 1)
[G]Well you can tell the world you never was my girl.
[G]You can burn my clothes when I am g[D]one.
[D]Or, you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been.
[D]And laugh and joke about me on the p[G]hone.

(Verse 2)
[G]You can tell my arms go back into the farm.
[G]Or you can tell my feet to hit the f[D]loor.
[D]Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips.
[D]They won't be reaching out for you no[G] more

(Chorus)
[G]But don't tell my heart, My achy breaky heart.
[G]I just don't think he'd u[D]nderstand.
[D]And if you tell my heart, My achy breaky heart,
[D]He might blow up and kill this[G] man. Ooohhh

(Break)

(Verse 3)
[G]You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas.
[G]Or you can tell your dog to bite my l[D]eg.
[D]Or tell your brother Cliff who's fist can tell my lip.
[D]He never really liked me[G] anyway.

(Verse 4)
[G]G Or tell your Aunt Louise. Tell anything you please.
[G]Myself already knows I'm not [D]ok.
[D]Or you can tell my eye to watch out for my mind,
[D]It might be walkin' out on me[G] today

(Chorus)
[G]But don't tell my heart, My achy breaky heart.
[G]I just don't think he'd u[D]nderstand.
[D]And if you tell my heart, My achy breaky heart,
[D]He might blow up and kill this[G] man. Ooohhh

(Chorus)
[G]But don't tell my heart, My achy breaky heart.
[G]I just don't think he'd u[D]nderstand.
[D]And if you tell my heart, My achy breaky heart,
[D]He might blow up and kill this[G] man. Ooohhh
