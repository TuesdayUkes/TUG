[Intro]
[Am]

[Verse]
[Am]Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway a place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance, I'm getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto, I've lived all over this town

[Chorus]
[E]This ain't no party, this ain't no disco, this ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey, I ain't got time for that now

[Verse]
[Am]Transmit the message, to the receiver, hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, couple of visas, don't even know my real name
High on a hillside, trucks are loading, everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime, I might not ever get home

[Chorus]
[E]This ain't no party, this ain't no disco, this ain't no fooling around
This ain't no mudd club, or C B G B,  I ain't got time for that now

[Solo]
[Am]
High on a hillside, trucks are loading, everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime, I might not ever get home
{textcolour}

[Chorus]
[E]This ain't no party, this ain't no disco, this ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey, I ain't got time for that now

[Verse]
[Am]Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?  heard about Pittsburgh, PA?
You oughta know not to stand by the window, somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter, to last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones, ain't got no records to play

[Chorus]
[E]Why stay in college? why go to night school?  gonna be different this time?
Can't write a letter, can't send a postcard, I can't write nothing at all
This ain't no party, this ain't no disco, this ain't no fooling around
I'd love to hold you, I'd like to kiss you, I ain't got no time for that now

[Verse]
[Am]Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock, we blended in with the crowd
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines, I know that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives, or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now, don't know what I look like!

You make me shiver, I feel so tender, we make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving, you ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?,  They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace, the burning keeps me alive

[Am] (fade out)
