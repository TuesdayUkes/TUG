[Am] Is it getting [Dsus2] better, [Fmaj7] or do you feel the [G] same
[Am] Will it make it [Dsus2] easier on you now [Fmaj7] you got someone to [G] blame
You say [C] one love, [Am] one life, [Fmaj7] when it's one need [C] in the night
It's one love, we get to [Am] share it
[Fmaj7] It leaves you baby if you don't [C] care for it
[Am] Is it getting [Dsus2] better, [Fmaj7] or do you feel the [G] same

[Am] Did I disa[Dsus2]-ppoint you, [Fmaj7] or leave a bad taste in your [G] mouth
[Am] You act like you never [Dsus2] had love, [Fmaj7] and you want me to go with[G]-out
Well it's [C] too late [Am] tonight, [Fmaj7] to drag the past out [C] into the light
We're one but we're [Am] not the same,

[Fmaj7] To the lepers in your [G] head
Did I [C] ask too much, [Am] more than a lot,

We're one but we're [Am] not the same,
We [Fmaj7] hurt each other then weâ€™re [C] doing it again, you say

[C] Love is a temple, [Am] love the higher law
[C] Love is a temple, [Am] love the higher law
[C] You ask me to enter, [G] but then you make me crawl
