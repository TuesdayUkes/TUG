Slip sliding a[G]way, slip sliding a[Em]way
You know the [G]nearer your desti[D]nation,
the [C]more you're slip [D]sliding a[G]way

I know a [Em]man, he came from [G]my hometown
He wore his [C]passion for his [D]woman like a [C]thorny crown[C7]
He said Do[G]lores, I live in [Em]fear
My love for [G]you's so over[D]powering,
I'm a[C]fraid that [D]I will disap[G]pear

Slip sliding a[G]way, slip sliding a[Em]way
You know the [G]nearer your desti[D]nation,
the [C]more you're slip [D]sliding a[G]way

And I know a [Em]woman, [D]  became a [G]wife
These are the [C]very words she [D]uses to des[C]cribe her life[C7]
She said a [G]good day ain't got no [Em]rain
She said a [G]bad day is when I [D]lie in bed
And [C]think of [D]things that might have [G]been

Slip sliding a[G]way, slip sliding a[Em]way
You know the [G]nearer your desti[D]nation,
the [C]more you're slip s[D]liding aw[G]ay    [F]  [C]  [G]

And I know a [Em]fathe[D]r who had a [G]son
He longed to [C]tell him all the [D]reasons for the [C]things heâ€™d done[C7]
He came a [G]long way just to ex[Em]plain
He kissed his [G]boy as he lay [D]sleeping
Then he [C]turned around and [D]headed home a[G]gain

He's slip slid[G]ing, slip sliding a[Em]way
You know the [G]nearer your desti[D]nation,
the [C]more you're slip [D]sliding a[G]way  [F]  [C]  [G]    [F]  [C]  [G]

And God only [Em]knows, God makes his [G]plan
The [C]information's un[D]available to the [C]mortal man[C7]
We're workin our [G]jobs, collect our [Em]pay
Believe we're [G]gliding down the [D]highway,
when in [C]fact we're slip [D]sliding a[G]way

Slip sliding a[G]way, slip sliding a[Em]way
