<PRE>To all TUGers: 

I won't be at next week's meeting because I'm performing at B.B. Rover's Cafe &amp; Pub for the Health Alliance for Austin Musicians' benefit day. Several venues around town will host HAAM Benefit shows, and this is my second year to participate as a performer. 

My time slot is 8 - 9 PM. I'll be performing with Paul Teneyuque (my regular duo partner) and Kaye Reznick, a mutual friend of ours. Please feel free to come by. BB Rovers is not only hosting, but they're contributing a percentage of the proceeds on beer and food sales that evening to HAAM. All tips will go to HAAM, and I'm donating a few CDs, so the $10 for each of them will go to HAAM. 

If you can't make, please tell your friends to come by. The music starts at 6:30 PM and doesn't finish until midnight.
