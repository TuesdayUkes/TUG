<PRE>I saw this on Facebook for anyone that wants to show up at Tyson's on Sunday at 8:30 AM on Sunday (might make for nice breakfast tacos).   I do not know what B Roll is UNLESS it is the interstitial shots they will use for the Food Network is filming Cheap Eats shoot.   I'm at work and don't have time to research (it may have been referenced in another post).  Perhaps some of you are &quot;friends&quot; with Tyson on Facebook and can look it up.  Just passin' this uke info along.

Tyson's Tacos


So they are going to be shooting B Roll on Sunday and they want to get people playing the Ukulele and shots of those who have tacos on the menu to be in the episode. I think that if you have a menu item, then it will be a shot of you with your item. That's Sunday at 8:30 AM. Then on Tuesday it'll be the story line where the host comes and has his miga plate and I'll prepare that for him. Still closed Monday afternoon and Tuesday sorry...but the good news is that if you come on Sunday at around 8, you'll probably get to be on TV.

 Hey friends----I am bowing
 out of the TUG performance at the recital.&#160; I have
 plenty to work on for that show already, and it&#8217;s
 giving me the willies.&#160; I&#8217;m sorry to be a party
 pooper, but I will be there to cheer you on!
