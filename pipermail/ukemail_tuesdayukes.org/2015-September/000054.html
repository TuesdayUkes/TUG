<PRE>Studio B is getting the floor painted this week - so we'll be meeting at 
Dart Bowl on Tuesday night (September 15). Dart Bowl is just south of 
Koenig, between Lamar and Woodrow - so it kind of splits the difference 
between Central Market and Kevin's house. There is PLENTY of parking.

  *Dart Bowl*
  5700 Grover Ave.
  Austin, TX 78756
  (512) 452-2518


We have the meeting room reserved from 7:00 to 9:00, it has plenty of 
room, and there is a bar and cafe is you want drinks and or food. If you 
have a portable music stand, it would probably be a good idea to bring 
it along. I've got a little projector that might work - but the walls 
have carpet - so there's no really any place to project. We'll try to 
figure it out -but better safe than sorry.

When you come in, just take a left, and go all the way down to the end 
by the lockers - the meeting room is right there.

Hope to see you there
