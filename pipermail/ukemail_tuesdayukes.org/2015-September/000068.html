<PRE>I'm feeling a little guilty for all my pithy replies earlier in this thread. Thank you Christine for this thorough and well-stated response. 

In the two years I've owned my cuatro, Elaine Filion has replaced strings on it twice. Both times she was working on other issues (although last time the &quot;issues&quot; included a broken string).

</I>&gt;<i> You're making me want to replace strings!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The uke I play most has had the same strings for over a year with few problems. Not sure how long to expect them to last.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I've changed in the past, the old strings were starting to show wear, like little grooves where they meet the frets. But the few times I've broken strings (Aquila and Living Water strings), there wasn't any wear and the strings hadn't been played much. Go figure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far, I prefer Worth clear. It wasn't hard to get used to the thinner strings, and they're very responsive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you like low G, the Worths have the option of a low G string made with the same fluorocarbon material as the others. It's less boomy sounding than a wound low G and doesn't overwhelm the other strings. It should also be thin enough to fit most ukes without modifying the nut. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of the wound low Gs I've tried, the Fremont Soloist that Charlie mentioned is my fave.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have changed strings a lot, usually until I find a set I like and even then I will probably change them after awhile.  But it is really up to the individual, I know some folks who still have the original strings on their ukes.  I think it also has to due with the uke and how it is made, and the feel a person prefers.  I would be careful about the gauge of the 3rd(C) string, in some sets these are to thick. If you are going to set up with Low G I would recommend the Fremont Soloist Wound Squekless Polished String, I haven't tried the other Fremont strings.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hey, rookie question(s), but how often should one typically expect to have to change strings?  Are there tell tale signs to look for that indicate it's time to change?
