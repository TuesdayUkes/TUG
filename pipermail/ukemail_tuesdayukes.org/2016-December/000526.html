Thanks for everyone's response.  Looks like this Holiday week has too many
conflicts.  We'll try to get everyone together during the New Year.  Happy
Holiday's and be safe this week!

What?  A chance to play uke that is only 6.5 miles from my Round Rock home?
Oh Joy!!  Please put me down for a yes.  I'll bring a finger food veggie
dish and probably just my uke.  Thanks to y'all for opening your home to
us!  ~  Nancy Lynch

Happy Holiday TUGsters! Soon the big day will be part of Christmas past,
and we'll all be relaxing from the shopping craze. Before you put those
Holiday Songs away and get ready for the New Year, let's get together and
play some tunes. We have plenty of space, so bring your significant others
along and we'll include them in the fun! Don't forget your favorite music
books and songs to share.

For some of you, we are on the far side of the moon, but please consider
taking the trek and we'll reward your efforts with a nice dinner and a fine
drink selection. We live near the Dell Diamond (baseball park), on the East
side of Round Rock.
