<PRE>Hey,

 

This email contains info about Westminster Manor (WM) performance tomorrow.

 

Attached is the program for Tuesday at the Westminster Manor. 

 

ABOUT WESTMINSTER MANOR &lt;<A HREF="http://westminsteraustintx.org/">http://westminsteraustintx.org/</A>&gt;  (I think they
shortened it to Westminster)

 

.          &lt;<A HREF="http://westminsteraustintx.org/map-directions.html">http://westminsteraustintx.org/map-directions.html</A>&gt; LOCATION

4100 JACKSON AVE, AUSTIN, TEXAS 78731 (512) 937-1933

 

.         PARKING

There is parking just north of the entrance on Bull Creek

            

 

.         ENTRANCE

If you have heavy gear you may want to drive to the entrance and drop stuff
off at the front desk and then park.

 



 

Check in at the front desk and they will give you directions to the Solarium
where we will perform.

 

DETAILS

.         The goal is to make a good impression at Westminster Manor in
hopes of getting a monthly gig there

.         Performers please try to arrive at 6:30p to allow time to park,
schlep gear to the Solarium and assemble

.         If you attend please wear Hawaiian shirt if at all possible

.         During the performance, we will make an appeal to the audience to
request our group on a monthly basis.

.         Mardi has volunteered to emcee (...sound of wild applause...).

.         Can audience members take pictures (or videos) of the performance?

.         I will bring a digital recorder that can hold an hour of recorded
music and hopefully this will capture everyone's performance

.         We are trying to work up a venue for February, so if you did not
perform this time hopefully you will perform in February

 

RUIZ LIBRARY DRESS REHEARSAL

 

Thank you to everyone that attended Ruiz Library dress rehearsal (pics
below). Special thanks to David Martinez who helped out as timekeeper, Nancy
Fitch who took photos and Mardi who brought delish cookies.
