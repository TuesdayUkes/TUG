<PRE>Hey,

Just wondering if anyone would have interest in working on James Hill's
&quot;The Ukulele Way&quot; over the summer?  For those unfamiliar with it, it's a
self-study, self-paced track for learning to combine melody, harmony and
rhythm on a single instrument.

I have all 6 textbooks (with companion CDs) and an annual subscription to
the online video tutorials.  FYI, the subscription is very affordable,
whether one goes the monthly or annual route (note that the prices shown on
the site are $Canadian, so the cost is even less in $US).  Also, all of the
text materials and companion audio are available via the site with a
subscription, so buying the books is optional, not a necessity.

I've identified at least a couple of potential locations (one north, one
south) for getting together to practice, and Skype is always an option, of
course.  And, I'm open to suggestions, too.

Here's a link to the free tour of the website:

Also, if anyone has an interest in the Blues, let's talk.  I'm trying to
pull together a &quot;curriculum&quot; loosely based on Ukulele Hunt's &quot;How to Play
Blues Ukulele&quot; combined with stuff cribbed from Griff Hamlin's &quot;Blues
Guitar Unleashed&quot; and related resources.  And, am open to suggestions,
especially if they'll help me sound a little more like BB!  ;-)

thanks,
Glenn
