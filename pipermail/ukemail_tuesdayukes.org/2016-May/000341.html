<PRE>Wow! Christine thanks for&#160;this wealth&#160;of good information. Even though I've been working this amplified uke bit for some time I'm still not there -&#160;acoustic w/ pickups versus solid body. This helps. One of your links makes a strong case for the Pono BE-DC Baritone Solidbody. Sure would like to get my hands on one.
Thanks again,polk&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hi, gang. Here's the gear we were talking about tonight!

Roland AC-33 amp
This is a small acoustic amp that a lot of people really like with ukuleles. At 30 watts, it's not very powerful, but it has a built-in looper and can run on batteries. It's pricey at over $400, so there are better deals out there. There are also 40W and 60W versions for a similar price, without the battery option.I bought my AC-33 used.

Fishman Loudbox Mini ampThe Mini is another popular acoustic amp for ukuleles. It's got 60 watts, much more powerful than the Roland, and is probably more rugged. Sweetwater has the best deal, offering a package with a free Sennheiser microphone, mic stand and mic cable. $330.Brock and Charlie both have this package.<A HREF="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/LoudBoxMiniPK">http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/LoudBoxMiniPK</A>
LR Baggs Para Acoustic D.I.This preamp with EQ really improves the sound and volume of a passive pickup. At $189, it's jumped in price since I bought mine, but you can often find them on Craigslist for about $100. Takes a 9V battery.<A HREF="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ParaDI">http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ParaDI</A>
PickupsThis blog post has some helpful info on pickups.&#160;My Pono has a passive under-saddle pickup and sometimes sounds kind of tinny or brittle plugged in, but the D.I. warms up the sound a lot.&#160;I hear good things about the K&amp;K Twinspot, also a passive pickup, and the MiSi, an active pickup (active pickups have built-in preamps, so most need a battery, but the MiSi is rechargeable/batteryless).<A HREF="http://liveukulele.com/gear/amplifying-your-ukulele/pickups/">http://liveukulele.com/gear/amplifying-your-ukulele/pickups/</A>
