Subject: [Ukemail] Brand New Key in a brand new key

We had a blast playing this last week in TUG! The original is in Db, and it's in C in the Halifax Ukulele Gang songbook&lt;<A HREF="https://halifaxukulelegang.wordpress.com/hug-songbook/">https://halifaxukulelegang.wordpress.com/hug-songbook/</A>&gt;, but Betsy thinks G would be a good key.

Give it a listen and see if there's a part you'd like to play or sing!

Here's the Jimmy Fallon/Melissa McCarthy lip-synch battle Deanna shared that started it all.

Brand New Key (Melanie Safka)

[G] I rode my bicycle past your window last night
[D7] I roller skated to your door at daylight
[G] It almost seems like you're avoiding me
[C] I'm okay alone, but you got [D7] something I need

Well, [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, you got a brand new key
I think that we should get together and try them out you see
[C] I been looking around awhile, you got something for me
Oh! [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, [D7] you got a brand new [G] key

[G] I ride my bike, I roller skate, don't drive no car
[D7] Don't go too fast, but I go pretty far
For [G] somebody who don't drive well I&#8217;ve been all around the world
[C] Some people say, I done all [D7] right for a girl

Well, [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, you got a brand new key
I think that we should get together and try them out you see
[C] I been looking around awhile, you got something for me
Oh! [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, [D7] you got a brand new [G] key

[G] I asked your mother if you were at home
[D7] She said, yes .. but you weren't alone
Oh, [G] sometimes I think that you're avoiding me [
F] I'm okay alone, but you've got [D7] something I need

Well, [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, you got a brand new key
I think that we should get together and try them out you see
[C] La la la la la la la la, [D7] la la la la la la
Oh! [G] I got a brand new pair of roller skates, [D7] you got a brand new [G] key
