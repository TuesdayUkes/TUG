<PRE>Sounds great, Kevin. This will also allow us to play any gigs that might come up, knowing that we've worked on a set of songs already.

</I>&gt;<i> Every other week (starting this week) we'll be having our regular PPP (Pick, Pass, or Play) session. On the in between weeks we'll focus in on a few songs each month - we'll have multiple parts for folks who want to pick (in notation and TABS) - as well as chords - and lyrics. We'll work on three songs at a time that fit together in a set. These in-between weeks will be known as the Interstitial TUG Band. We'll mostly rehearse from paper copies. There will be parts for every skill level - and we think this will (hopefully) add something fun and rewarding to TUG. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To start us off - we have 3 Holiday Songs - Mele Kalikimaka, Carol of the Bells, and  What Are you Doing New Year's Eve. All the parts are here:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The LEAD parts have the chords, lyrics, and melody line. The other parts have TABS as well as notation. The first Insterstitial meeting will be Dec 6. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We'll email reminders each week so we can keep straight what we'll be doing at each TUG meeting.
