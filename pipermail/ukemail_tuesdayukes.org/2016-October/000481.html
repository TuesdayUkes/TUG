<PRE>Hi All,


Unless I hear different, let's meet tomorrow in Kevin C's Studio B.  So TUG tomorrow in our typical space in Kevin C's Studio B to (hopefully) rehearse the Hope Church set list.


Thanks,


Nancy

Nobody ever responded to my offer to have TUG at my house tomorrow, but I can host it here or meet y'all at Kevin's studio B. Just let me know which way to jump.

Also, I'd rather do &quot;Thank My Ukulele&quot; first with the group (any and all welcome to join in) before doing my solo.

Hi All,

Following this weekend, I made some changes to the lineup for this Wednesday's Hope Presbyterian Church performance.  Please let me know if anything is unclear or if there are any concerns about the spreadsheet (far) below.

One question I do have, tomorrow (TUG Tuesday) is the group meeting in Studio B at Kevin's casa or The John D's casa?  I know the group did not meet last Tuesday and I want to make sure we are all on the same page about tomorrow's TUG meeting at the correct location.

One final thing:  Below are the details for this Wednesday's Presbyterian Church performance (as yet, another a reminder):
