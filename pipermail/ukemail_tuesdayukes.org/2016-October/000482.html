<PRE>Hey TUGsters,
I wish I could be at this gig&#160;to play with you guys, but I can't make this one. Have fun and I know the Hope folks will enjoy the music.

 &lt;!--#yiv1246244552 P {margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;}--&gt;Hi All,
Unless I hear different, let's meet tomorrow in Kevin C's Studio B. &#160;So TUG tomorrow in our typical space in Kevin C's Studio B to (hopefully) rehearse the Hope Church set list.
Thanks,
NancyFrom: John Davenport &lt;<A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">davenport924 at yahoo.com</A>&gt;

Subject: Re: [Ukemail] TUG's Hope Presbyterian Church Gig - This Wednesday! Updates and an Unanswered Question.&#160;Nobody ever responded to my offer to have TUG at my house tomorrow, but I can host it here or meet y'all at Kevin's studio B. Just let me know which way to jump.&#160;
Also, I'd rather do &quot;Thank My Ukulele&quot; first with the group (any and all welcome to join in) before doing my solo.
