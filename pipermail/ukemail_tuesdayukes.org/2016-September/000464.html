<PRE>Sounds great!!!


Here's what I have confirmed, please let me know if this is wrong and if you have answers to the questions in bold:


Confirmed Solo Groups/Individual Act:
1.  Group - Polk, Angel and Betsy:  Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace
2.  Solo - The John Davenport:  Thank You My Ukulele
3.  Group - Gary and Nancy:  A surprised to be determined (not sure if one or two songs, can you let me know?)
4.  Group - Brock, Charlie and (maybe Christine):  One or Two Songs (please let me know, when y'all know)

General Information and (my questions):
Dave:  On backup bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)
Deanna:  I am not sure if open to singing individually or in a group (either way, great talent).
TUG Group:  Anyone interested in leading the group with a TUG song or two?

Also, please remember:
Jack has reserved a room at Ruiz Library for 9/24 Sat from 1pm - 4pm - it would be a good time/place for any Tugsters who want to get in a practice session for the Hope sessions.

Have a great weekend and take care,

Nancy

Hi Nancy,
If you have room Brock and I and maybe Christine (she might be busy) would like to join in for a song or two. Let me know what you think.

Hi All,


OK here's what I gathered from last night at TUG, please respond if anything is not 100% correct.


Confirmed:

1.  Group - Polk, Angel and Betsy:  Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace (awesome).

2.  Solo - The John Davenport:  Thank You My Ukulele (a great original).

3.  Group - Gary and Nancy:  A surprised to be determined (can't wait to 'unwrap it').

4.  Dave:  On backup bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)

5:  Deanna (with her beautiful voice, possible providing harmony with Betsy on the group songs)

6.  Group - Two TUG group songs:  California Stars and ______  (I am not sure what the second song is?)


Not attending or not confirmed:

Kendall will be with her husband enjoying his birthday.

Kevin J is 50/50 due to work scheduling.

Mike will be enjoying a holiday (I believe it is a holiday?) with his wife.


Gary said he can get a mic or two.  I am not sure of anything else that might be needed?


I think we have time for another song or two or three (better to have too much than not enough).  Anyone else or group want to join in?


Thanks,


Nancy
