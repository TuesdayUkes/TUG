<PRE>Hi TUG, Gary and Nancy -

Thanks for the updates and questions!

I am available that Wednesday 5:00 until 6:30 sharp to help with anything
from singing to playing to setting up. Let me/us know what time to show up
and lend a hand.

If you need me to sing a harmony part or a solo as the group plays, I am
available (within a lower range...D-ish to A/B-ish), but prefer a week's
notice on a song selection, arrangement and key to prepare.

That said, mostly happy to support, but don't feel compelled nor opposed to
performing a &quot;solo&quot; act. Open to whatever you need!

And, sadly can't make this Tuesday to TUG. I have my first ever voice
lesson. Hooray!

Cheers!
Deanna

Sounds great!!!


Here's what I have confirmed, please let me know if this is wrong and if
you have answers to the questions in bold:


*Confirmed Solo Groups/Individual Act:*
1.  Group - Polk, Angel and Betsy:  Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace
2.  Solo - The John Davenport:  Thank You My Ukulele
3.  Group - Gary and Nancy:  A surprised to be determined *(not sure if one
or two songs, can you let me know?)*
4.  Group - Brock, Charlie and (maybe Christine):  One or Two Songs *(please
let me know, when y'all know)*

General Information and (*my questions):*
Dave:  On backup bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)
Deanna:  *I am not sure if open to singing individually or in a group
(either way, great talent). *
TUG Group:  *Anyone interested in leading the group with a TUG song or two?*

Also, please remember:
*Jack has reserved a room at Ruiz Library for 9/24 Sat from 1pm - 4pm - it
would be a good time/place for any Tugsters who want to get in a practice
session for the Hope sessions.*

Have a great weekend and take care,

Nancy

Hi Nancy,
If you have room Brock and I and maybe Christine (she might be busy) would

Hi All,


OK here's what I gathered from last night at TUG, please respond if
anything is not 100% correct.


*Confirmed:*

1.  Group - Polk, Angel and Betsy:  Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace
(awesome).

2.  Solo - The John Davenport:  Thank You My Ukulele (a great original).

3.  Group - Gary and Nancy:  A surprised to be determined (can't wait to
'unwrap it').

4.  Dave:  On backup bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)

5:  Deanna (with her beautiful voice, possible providing harmony with Betsy
on the group songs)

6.  Group - Two TUG group songs:  California Stars and ______  (I am not
sure what the second song is?)


*Not attending or not confirmed:*

Kendall will be with her husband enjoying his birthday.

Kevin J is 50/50 due to work scheduling.

Mike will be enjoying a holiday (I believe it is a holiday?) with his wife.


Gary said he can get a mic or two.  I am not sure of anything else that
might be needed?


I think we have time for another song or two or three (better to have too
much than not enough).  Anyone else or group want to join in?


Thanks,


Nancy
