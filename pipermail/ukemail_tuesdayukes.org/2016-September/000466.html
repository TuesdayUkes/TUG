<PRE>If possible, I'd like to do &quot;Thank My Ukulele&quot; with Polk playing lead (and anyone else who wants to join in), and I'd also like to do a solo, too. Will present the second song to TUG next week.

#yiv0303978947 #yiv0303978947 -- P {margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;}#yiv0303978947 Sounds great!!!
Here's what I have confirmed, please let me know if this is wrong and if you have answers to the questions in bold:
Confirmed Solo Groups/Individual Act:1. &#160;Group -&#160;Polk, Angel and Betsy: &#160;Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace&#160;2. &#160;Solo -&#160;The John Davenport: &#160;Thank You My Ukulele&#160;3. &#160;Group -&#160;Gary and Nancy: &#160;A surprised to be determined (not sure if one or two songs, can you let me know?)4. &#160;Group - Brock, Charlie and (maybe Christine): &#160;One or Two Songs (please let me know, when y'all know)
General Information and (my questions):Dave: &#160;On backup&#160;bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)
Deanna: &#160;I am not sure if open to singing individually or in a group (either way, great talent).&#160;
TUG&#160;Group: &#160;Anyone interested in leading the group with a TUG song or two?
Also, please remember: &#160;Jack has reserved a room at Ruiz Library for 9/24 Sat from 1pm - 4pm - it would be a good time/place for any Tugsters who want to get in a practice session for the Hope sessions.
Have a great weekend and take care,
Nancy

Hi All,
OK here's what I gathered from last night at TUG, please respond if anything is not 100%&#160;correct.
Confirmed:1. &#160;Group -&#160;Polk, Angel and Betsy: &#160;Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace (awesome).2. &#160;Solo -&#160;The John Davenport: &#160;Thank You My Ukulele (a great original).3. &#160;Group -&#160;Gary and Nancy: &#160;A surprised to be determined (can't wait to 'unwrap it').4. &#160;Dave: &#160;On backup&#160;bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)5: &#160;Deanna (with her beautiful voice, possible providing harmony with Betsy on the group songs)6. &#160;Group -&#160;Two TUG group songs: &#160;California Stars and ______ &#160;(I am not sure what the second song is?)
Not attending or not confirmed:Kendall will be with her husband enjoying his birthday.Kevin J is 50/50 due to work&#160;scheduling.Mike will be enjoying a holiday (I believe it is a holiday?) with his wife.
Gary said he can get a mic or two. &#160;I am not sure of anything else that might be needed?
I think we have time for another song or two or three (better to have too much than not enough). &#160;Anyone else or group want to join in?
Thanks,
Nancy
