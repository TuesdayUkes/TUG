<PRE>A polka band!   That would be great!  I bet some folks in the audience will get up and dance to a polka.

Hi TUGsters,

 

Here's the 'closer to finalized' spreadsheet of our gig at Hope Presbyterian Church on Wednesday, October 5th.  Again, the potluck dinner starts at 5:45 PM and they are having TUG play 6:00 - 6:30 PM.  

 

Please know, I accounted four minutes for each song (to get set up, play each song and receive the cheers from the crowd) I know some might take more or less but that seemed like a logical time frame to use.

 

Finally as a heads up, I will not be at TUG for a few weeks (I signed up for a five week, free guitar program that I couldn't pass up).  I'll be at the Ruiz Library this Saturday (a bit late due to a teacher's union meeting earlier that day) and Hope Church on Wednesday, 5th but not physically at TUG starting this Tuesday for five weeks.

 

Most importantly, please check out the information below and let me know if anything is not correct.

Gary (and Kevin, &quot;Hi Kevin, I just wanted to keep you in the loop and see if there are any issues on your end&quot;),

 

I will not be at TUG for the next few weeks (long story, taking a guitar class for free).  I will send the spreadsheet with all the confirmed songs for the HOPE church.

 

Can you check in with the TUG group tomorrow to confirm all is good to go?

 

Also, I think three songs might be pushing our time limit (30 minutes).  I have each group listed for each song at four minutes each.  Would two be OK and you and Nancy have and extra in your back pocket, if needed, for a time filler?

 

Thanks, oh and call or text if that's easier than email.  I'm at (512) 983-8460.  I will be at the Ruiz Library this Saturday to continue to help coordinate and will be at the church but will not be physically be at TUG due to guitar classes (for five weeks).

 

Thanks,

 

Nancy

Hi Nancy,

 

Nancy Lynch and I are hoping to play 3 songs &#8211; one folk, one country, and one pop.  Is that overdoing it? 

 

By the way, I really appreciate everyone&#8217;s willingness to play that evening.  

 

Gary

Hi TUG, Gary and Nancy -

Thanks for the updates and questions!

I am available that Wednesday 5:00 until 6:30 sharp to help with anything from singing to playing to setting up. Let me/us know what time to show up and lend a hand.

If you need me to sing a harmony part or a solo as the group plays, I am available (within a lower range...D-ish to A/B-ish), but prefer a week's notice on a song selection, arrangement and key to prepare.

That said, mostly happy to support, but don't feel compelled nor opposed to performing a &quot;solo&quot; act. Open to whatever you need!

And, sadly can't make this Tuesday to TUG. I have my first ever voice lesson. Hooray!

Cheers!
Deanna

Sounds great!!!

 

Here's what I have confirmed, please let me know if this is wrong and if you have answers to the questions in bold:

 

Confirmed Solo Groups/Individual Act:

1.  Group - Polk, Angel and Betsy:  Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace 

2.  Solo - The John Davenport:  Thank You My Ukulele 

3.  Group - Gary and Nancy:  A surprised to be determined (not sure if one or two songs, can you let me know?)

4.  Group - Brock, Charlie and (maybe Christine):  One or Two Songs (please let me know, when y'all know)

 

General Information and (my questions):

Dave:  On backup bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)

Deanna:  I am not sure if open to singing individually or in a group (either way, great talent). 

TUG Group:  Anyone interested in leading the group with a TUG song or two?

 

Also, please remember:   

Jack has reserved a room at Ruiz Library for 9/24 Sat from 1pm - 4pm - it would be a good time/place for any Tugsters who want to get in a practice session for the Hope sessions.

 

Have a great weekend and take care,

 

Nancy

Hi Nancy,

If you have room Brock and I and maybe Christine (she might be busy) would like to join in for a song or two. Let me know what you think.

Hi All,

 

OK here's what I gathered from last night at TUG, please respond if anything is not 100% correct.

 

Confirmed:

1.  Group - Polk, Angel and Betsy:  Uke/Flute Trio of Amazing Grace (awesome).

2.  Solo - The John Davenport:  Thank You My Ukulele (a great original).

3.  Group - Gary and Nancy:  A surprised to be determined (can't wait to 'unwrap it').

4.  Dave:  On backup bass ukulele (providing wonderful thump, thumps)

5:  Deanna (with her beautiful voice, possible providing harmony with Betsy on the group songs)

6.  Group - Two TUG group songs:  California Stars and ______  (I am not sure what the second song is?)

 

Not attending or not confirmed:

Kendall will be with her husband enjoying his birthday.

Kevin J is 50/50 due to work scheduling.

Mike will be enjoying a holiday (I believe it is a holiday?) with his wife.

 

Gary said he can get a mic or two.  I am not sure of anything else that might be needed?

 

I think we have time for another song or two or three (better to have too much than not enough).  Anyone else or group want to join in?

 

Thanks,

 

Nancy
