<PRE>Nancy &amp;&#160;John,
Could I ask that&#160;we move Thank My Uke down one or more slots, maybe after John's individual song. I will be playing a baritone on the first two songs and a tenor&#160;with John. I plan on using an amp so I would like a little&#160;time to change over.
Thanks,polk&#160;

Subject: Re: [Ukemail] Gary's Gig - Hope Church&#160;Hi TUG, Gary and Nancy -Thanks for the updates and questions!I am available that Wednesday 5:00 until 6:30 sharp to help with anything from singing to playing to setting up. Let me/us know what time to show up and lend a hand.If you need me to sing a harmony part or a solo as the group plays, I am available (within a lower range...D-ish to A/B-ish), but prefer a week's notice on a song selection, arrangement and key to prepare.That said, mostly happy to support, but don't feel compelled nor opposed to performing a &quot;solo&quot; act. Open to whatever you need!And, sadly can't make this Tuesday to TUG. I have my first ever voice lesson. Hooray!Cheers!
