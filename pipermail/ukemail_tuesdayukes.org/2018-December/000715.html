<PRE>Here's what's up for the next TUG meeting Tuesday Dec 18 - Hancock Center

First up - great job at the Xmas party - we sounded good - and ended together! Rich was amazing on his open mic - that was a great song! I'll post something on the web site this weekend.&#160;

We'll meet at St John's Library (7500 Blessing Ave, Austin, TX 78752) at 4:00 - and play at 4:15. Attached are the song sheets. I'll bring a couple of stands. Vivienne has the sing-along sheets to pass out. Wear your Xmas shirts - and we ended up with a couple of hats so I'll bring those along as well. See you there!

We'll reconvene at Hancock at 6:30 (or 7:00) for the regular TUG. I'll also bring some print outs of the Uke-along sheets - so if we do a post-TUG Brewtorium session we can play from those.&#160;

We'll be meeting (mostly) in Room 5 - (The big room&#160;downstairs)


6:30 - 7:00 - Flash Class/Practice Group

Tremolo Strum, Rhumba Strum,


7:00 - 8:30ish - TUG
