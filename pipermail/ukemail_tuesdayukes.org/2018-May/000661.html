<PRE>Hanock Center is doing mainetance next week - so no TUG (May 15). Our next meeting will be Tuesday May 22. We'll focus on our songs for St John's Library since that is coming up that Friday - St John's Library, 3:15pm (be there at 3:00).&#160;

The Uke-along at Oscar Blues went well - we took our loaner ukes - and a an innocent bystander got sucked into the uke-vortex - she even showed up at AUS on Thursday! Weather was great - there were $2 beers - and the Oscar Blues management said we could come back anytime - so we'll probably make that a regular thing.&#160;

We took our new rack (thanks to Marty) and five loaner ukes to the Austin Ukulele Society meeting this week &#160; - four of them were picked up and used during the meeting - which is great for the first appearance. Lots of folks came up afterward to check them out - and it looks like the demand might exceed the supply. We'll be using them at St John's for the Uke petting zoo as well. Hopefully they'll get played alot going &#160;forward.&#160;

I'll try to get a song sheet together for St John's before the next meeting and send it out (and I'll bring hard copies to the meeting as well).&#160;

In June we'll go back to semi-monthly theme - so be thinking about a theme for June - we'll talk about it at the meeting.&#160;

We're also going to change up the format a little. We'll have 6 or so songs that we'll work on each month - and we'll play a couple of those at the begiing and end of each meeting. After that we'll have an &quot;open mic&quot; for anyone who wants to practice playing in front of folks, then we'll play anything someone brings, and if there is nothing new - we'll finish on our monthly songs. We'll put the songs we work on in a book for our uke-alongs - and performances like St John's.&#160;

Last - and least - I've updated the web site - &#160;<A HREF="http://">http://</A> tuesdayukes.org&#160;- I've got our calendar right up at the top - and I'll try to keep it up to date.&#160;

Whew - that's it - see y'all in a couple of weeks!
