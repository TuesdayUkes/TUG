<PRE>Our St John&#8217;s Library event is tomorrow - we&#8217;ll meet at the Library a little before 3:00pm, we go on at 3:15, and after we play we&#8217;ll host the ukulele petting zoo. 

I expect we&#8217;ll be done by 5:00 or so. 

For next Tuesday we&#8217;ll pick the theme for the next month or so - we&#8217;ll be doing a field trip every other month - so maybe we should use the field trips to organize our themes. We can talk about it on Tuesday - but either way way we&#8217;ll decide on our next theme. 

Also for Tuesday&#8217;s session we&#8217;ll start on our new/old format



2-3 Songs to kick it off (old/new/theme/whatever)

Open Mic - if anyone wants to play for the group

Performance song - a song we&#8217;re working up to perform - or to back up someone who wants to perform. 

2-3 Theme Songs - songs people bring in/songs already in our theme set

Closing Song - ??Should we pick one? Maybe one each theme?


We&#8217;ll try to plan the opener, performance  and closing songs each week so we don;t spend a bunch of time deciding what to do. I&#8217;ll endeavor to send out an email each week with the plan for the next meeting. 





</PRE>
