<PRE>We have our Uke-along at Central Market this week because of the rain - and had a great time - we had a whole table of ladies do a Flash Class - and had dancers and walk ups while we played. But - it's too confusing to have an alternative location for bad weather - so we're going to be looking for one place where we can play inside (and out). Along those lines we'll be having our Uke Alongs quarterly in 2019 - The first Tuesday in Jan April July Oct - and that means that the first one will be Tuesday January 1. That could be fun. We'll shoot out info as we get it organized.&#160;

Here's the start of our song book for the last quarter of 2018. Please send me any songs you want added - or bring them to a meeting. I'll also be posting this on the web site so you can always grab one there. By the end of Dec we should have 12-16 songs.&#160;

Another thing we're going to work on is a Grand Jam - we'll try to get the various Ukulele Groups that have formed around town together on some Saturday for a big Uke Jam - we'll let you know when that comes together.&#160;

Austin Parks and Rec has asked us to send out this survey to all participants. If you don't want to do it online you can pick one up at Hancock.&#160;

We also are going back to the roll sheet we used to fill out - bring your card with you the next time you come out so I can get your ID# - I'll put together a pre-printed roll sheet so we can just check where we're there &#160;(rather than fill out all that stuff every time)&#160;
