<PRE>Here's what's up for the next TUG meeting Tuesday &#160;- 25 June Hancock Rec Center

We'll be meeting in Room 5 - (The big room&#160;downstairs)

Our UkeAlong is Tuesday July 2 - 7:00 at Central Market &#160;- 4100 N Lamar. We'll be either on the porch or on the deck on the south side of the building - next to the cafe. Look - and listen for ukes. Bring a stand if you have one - we'll have printed copies of the song sheets - loaner ukes and some percussion implements - so bring your friends and&#160;neighbors!

On Thursday, June 27 we're having a little iPad/OnSong Tech session at the North Village Library from 2:00 - 3:30. Bring your iPad and your uke. If you already have OnSong installed - that would be great. You may also want to install DropBox (dropbox.com) - which is a good way to move/store music files. We'll also make a quick pass through the OnSong Console - which allows you to manage/edit OnSong files from your desktop computer.&#160;


6:30 - 7:00 - Flash Class/Practice Group

2 Chord Songs


7:00 - 8:30ish - TUG

Repetiore Songs

Open Mic - If you want to play something for the group

Current Songs&#160;

If you have a song you'd like the group to play - send it to <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">tug_info at tuesdayukes.org</A> &#160; or <A HREF="../../../mailman/listinfo/ukemail_tuesdayukes.org.html">ukemail at tuesdayukes.org</A> &#160; or just bring a copy to the meeting. We'll work it into the rotation.&#160;
