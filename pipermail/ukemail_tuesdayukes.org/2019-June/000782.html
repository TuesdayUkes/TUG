<PRE>For anyone interested.&#160;

I'm going to be doing a weekly singalong at the Westminster Manor nursing facility (The Arbors). We did a month of &quot;classes&quot; for the residents - and there was some interest - but these folks have multiple challenges. We were able to get some folks strumming ZED chords - and got some folks playing ostinado along with chords. &#160; Residents don't show up, they come and go, they don't get what's going on - but some of them strum, and some of them sing, some do both.The activity director (Monica) is working on learning the ukulele so she'll be able to use that going forward.&#160;

To support her and the residents I'd like to get a small group &#160;of folks who could dedicate an hour each Monday to playing for/with these folks. I think if can get something resular going Monica will get more particiaption.&#160;

The session is 10:30am each Monday at Westminster Manor (4100 Jackson, Austin) - we go for about 45 minutes. Attached is the song list we'll be working from. From that list we'll do six or seven songs each week. We repeat each song, and we play slowly - mostly using a simple downstrum. &#160;We connect an iPad to a big screen TV to show the lyrics/chords, etc.&#160;

Anyway - if you're interested email me&#160;

Thanks

Kevin
