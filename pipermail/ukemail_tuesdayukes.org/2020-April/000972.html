<PRE>Hey Y'all --

We'll be having our Online Open Mic on Tuesday at 7:00pm. See the connection info below. We'll open with a song - this week it's Particle Man - I think in these times of trouble we need Triangle Man. PDF with the opener and closer is attached.&#160;

If you haven't been to one yet - you can check out the recordings of the previous open mics on the Tug Web site - on the&#160;Online Open Mic&#160;Page

It's pretty simple - we go around the circle and anyone who has a piece to play plays it - there is a little process to that

1) The Host (me) - mutes everyone and Spotlights the player
2) The Host then unmutes the player - and tells them they are unmuted
3) The Player plays
4) The Host tries to unmute everyone at the end of the song - there is usually little lag

It's a little kludgy - but we muddle through

So, if you have something you've been working on - or just would like to see other uke players - join in!

Hope to see you Tuesday!

Kevin Jolly is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.
