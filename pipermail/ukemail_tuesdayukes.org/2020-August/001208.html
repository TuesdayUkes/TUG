<PRE>TL;DR [C] ChordPro [G] songs are [Am] lyrics [F] with [Fm] embedded chords.
[Fm]A-[C]men.

For those who have asked, I've attached a sample ChordPro file. It is just
a text file, and you can edit one with pretty much any editor, although
Word doesn't recognize the file extension by default. If you want to write
up a song and save it as a .doc or .docx, I can easily use it. Or you could
just type it into an email, and I'll copy-paste it into a file.

It is perfectly fine to have just lyrics with chords embedded in square
brackets [G].

If you want to get fancy, you can add the title in curly brackets {title:
This is my Song}, (you can abbreviate &quot;title:&quot; as just &quot;t:&quot;). Kevin's
convention had been to use the subtitle for the author's name {st: Written
by Me}.

If you have directions for the player, you can just add them in
parentheses. Or you can use the comment format {c: kazoo break}. These will
show up as highlighted text.

The fanciest thing I've done is colour the text red when it is not intended
to be sung, but just used as a reminder of how an instrumental section fits
the rest of the song. Note that you have to use the British spelling
{textcolour: red}, add another one with no color specified to go back to
the default {textcolour}.

Note that all the things in curly brackets need to be on a line by
themselves or they will be ignored.

I've embedded the contents of the attached file below.
