<PRE>Hey thanks Paul for sending your list of most-listened-to tracks of 2019.
You sound like a rocker to me!  My streaming service (Deezer, which rhymes
with Geezer) doesn't seem to track my listening, or it probably does but I
haven't figured it out. Because I'm a Geezer.

Anyway, for 2020 I highly recommend Uncle Walt's Band, in case any of you
don't know them. A wonderful acoustic trio that used to play Austin in the
70's (Warren Hood is the son of the late Champ Hood, one of the members.)
Their music only recently went to streaming, so if you don't know them yet,
check them out!

Also since we played that Raul Malo song recently at Tuesday Ukes, I've
been revisiting him, and it's a pleasure. What a voice.

Happy New Year everyone, and if you want, please share your own listening
ideas so we can expand our musical horizons.

See you soon,
Mauri
