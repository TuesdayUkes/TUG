 #yiv7670103023 P {margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;}Just talked again to Karen, ca. 5pm.&#160; They are going to try a somewhat risky procedure to try and improve his blood flow.&#160; They have been pumping his blood into his heart but it is too weak to send enough blood out and some of it is pooling.&#160; I don't understand what they are going to do, but they seem to think it is the only viable option.&#160; He desperately needs time to heal and restore vital functions before they can operate on heart. &#160;&#160; She will let me know how it goes.
More backstory.&#160; The doctor thinks his heart crisis started Friday evening.&#160; Karen says they were trying takeout from new restaurant and he became nauseous, blaming it on food poisoning.&#160; Wouldn't let Karen take him to clinic, but suffered through the night.&#160; Saturday morning he made it to his chair and was quite lucid, but was still struggling and around 1pm started having trouble breathing.&#160; Covid-19, they wondered?&#160; Karen insisted he go to the clinic, but he ask her to call EMS as he could not walk to car.&#160;

EMS tech soon sensed that it was an heart issue, while he was still sitting in his chair: don't move.&#160; Six fireman soon hauled him out of the house (still in chair?) and transferred him to ambulance.&#160; They had just gotten him to Seaton emergency room when massive heart attack occurred (ca. 1:30pm). He was &quot;out&quot; for 10 minutes of respiratory failure (blood wasn't circulating), but they were applying CPR and other things during this.&#160; Karen says that had the massive attack happened at home (or perhaps even in route), he would not have made it. 

So, he is lucky to be alive and hopefully the new procedure will help buy him time to stabilize and restore functions so they can operate.
