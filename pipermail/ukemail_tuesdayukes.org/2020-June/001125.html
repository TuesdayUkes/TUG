Hi, Walter,

So glad to hear from you and that you are recovering nicely!

See you tomorrow night.

 I just sent a response to Marty but not to everyone else. It looks as if I&#8217;m getting out of the hospital today, so I&#8217;ll be home tonight. Please let me know if we&#8217;re going to get something for Karen.
I&#8217;ll be at the meeting tomorrow night, so I imagine we&#8217;ll talk about where TUG goes from here. It&#8217;s really terrible to learn about this just as I&#8217;m happy to be getting out of here. It reminds us how fragile life is.
Talk to everyone soon. &#8212;W

Oh such a loss of such a wonderful man. I feel so sad as I know everyone does. So sudden. What a shock. My heart goes out to his wife. I&#8217;ll join the zoom on Tuesday. See you then.&#160;

We can set up a care calendar so we can sign up and schedule times to bring her a meal.&#160;
I&#8217;ve been absent but getting the emails and have been happy to see y&#8217;all so active. What a loss for our community.&#160;

Hi, Marty,

That's such a loss for all of us. It seems impossible. Very, very sad.

Aside from getting together on Tuesday, is there a way we can do something, like maybe for his wife?

With sadness, and appreciation for my TUG friends,

It is with a deep sadness I have to report to you all that Kevin passed away this afternoon. My wife just got off the phone with his wife Karen.&#160; She said he wished to be cremated and she will honor his wishes.&#160; She will plan a celebration of his life after the virus emergency is over.
