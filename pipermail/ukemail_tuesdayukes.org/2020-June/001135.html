<PRE>The attached message is from Kevin&#8217;s friend Steve Black for your info...
Also please remember the Zoom meeting tonight. &#160;My wife Linda and I visited with Kevin&#8217;s wife Karen and his son Don this afternoon. &#160;Don said he would like to start learning the ukulele and would be at tonight&#8217;s Zoom meeting!
Here&#8217;s the link:<A HREF="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81372712176?pwd=OGpQdnhacFVrcHdnaDYrWHVqU2FLQT09&#160;">https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81372712176?pwd=OGpQdnhacFVrcHdnaDYrWHVqU2FLQT09&#160;</A>

 #yiv9166646738 P {margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;}Fellow Friends of Kevin (please pass along):
I write to update you all on evolving plans to remember our beloved friend and uniter and help us deal with the grief.&#160;

Karen and Don are holding up, as she put it: 'Kevin prepared me well by being willing to discuss all logical life possibilities, usually jokingly, so I knew exactly what he wanted and have had no qualms about what to do.' Don is very grateful that he moved back to Austin from the east coast in 2019 and he and Kevin had much of the last year to reforge their bond.&#160; They both want to share and hear Kevin stories.

Karen is convinced that Kevin really departed this earth when the massive heart attack happened on Saturday afternoon.&#160; They kept some of his functions technically alive for another 27 hours, but he was already gone.&#160; We all know he would have hated lingering in hospital with no prospect of returning to full life.&#160; Perhaps a sudden and quick end was the way it had to happen.

I know that many of you are struggling with his sudden departure, just like me.&#160; He can't be gone.&#160; I've been trying to stop weeping with almost every trigger, just like I am now. ... I think most of us will only find solace through remembering and sharing.&#160; So here is what is being planned. 

Years ago Kevin made me pledge I would write his obituary, which I agreed to do only if he promised to write mine.&#160; I lost.&#160; With Karen and Don's help -- and we welcome any direct communications with ideas and unknown-to-me facts that might be relevant -- a proper obituary will be published next week in Austin and San Antonio papers.&#160; It will be too long, but not near long enough.
Karen and Don want very much to have a proper wake, up close and rubbing elbows, swilling beer, retelling Kevin stories, show and telling, eating good food.&#160; But that can't happen until the pandemic is dealt with.&#160; When conditions allow, unknown months from now, we will do just that and hold a wake he would have approved of. 

In the meantime two more timely things are in the works.&#160; There will be a Kevin Jolly Zoom Wake on Thursday, June 25th, 4:30pm until it ends.&#160; Details early next week, but be thinking about what you might share. We can anticipate dozens of participants, so each of us will have to settle on a particular story to share or song to sing. 

The all-too-inadequate Zoom Wake will be followed by a website that will allow each of us to add stories, pictures, videos, etc. at greater length.&#160; I don't know yet when this will happen, but sooner than later.&#160; More details next week.

Yours in the Kevo cause, Stevo 

PS:&#160; Some of you know that Kevin was the cook in the family - planned the meals, bought (exactly) what was needed, and did all the cooking (except some baking).&#160; Kevin even made Karen lunches to take to work, organized and sitting on the designated refrigerator shelf awaiting her to grab it on the way out the door.&#160; Don is concerned that now she isn't eating much.&#160; We three talked about this and Karen laughingly revealed that one of the things that she and Kevin joked about was what each of them would do if the other passed first.&#160; Kevin was worried that he wouldn't be able to sleep without the many night-owl sounds she made - doing dishes, playing harp, etc. -- after he went to bed, early as usual.&#160; Karen was worried that until she learned to cook again she would only be eating oatmeal.&#160;&#160; So, if a few of you in the Austin area were able to drop off a small prepared dinner or lunch or two now and again, I think Karen would eat better.
