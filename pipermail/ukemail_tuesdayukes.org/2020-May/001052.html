Subject: [Ukemail] Del Rey TUG Workshop

 

Mark your calendars

 

Wednesday, May 27 at 7:00pm - Del Rey is going to host a Zoom workshop for TUG (and Lamar and Baca).

 

If you're not familiar with Del she is an amazing blues ukulele (and guitar) player and teacher. Check out her web site - 

 

<A HREF="https://delreyplays.com/">https://delreyplays.com/</A>

 

and/or  - check out this extensive play list - <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3G6UTOZzczUyI6MDif3dVg47_D3uxYKW">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3G6UTOZzczUyI6MDif3dVg47_D3uxYKW</A>

 

For our workshop we'll be learning CC Rider - a great blues tune first recorded by Ma Rainey in 1924. Del will lead us through a rhythm (strumming) part, a melody part, and turnarounds - and we'll end up with a complete ensemble piece - for when we're all back together again. Del does a great job of breaking a tune down into parts which are accessible for folks with lots of different skill levels - so there will be something for everyone. 

 

There will be no charge for the workshop  - but we are asking folks who are so inclined to leave a tip (via PayPal)  and/or buy a CD (digital or physical). We'll have full details on that as the day gets here. 

 

We'd like folks to RSVP before Friday, May 22. Just let us know if you plan to attend.

 

So, how will this work?

 

Del is going to put together a You Tube video of the CC Rider lesson - and she'll make it available to us a week before the workshop. We'll send the link to the video to everyone who RSVP's and then we'll individually take a look at that - practice, etc. On Wednesday, May 27 we'll meet on Zoom with Del, she'll take us through the material in person - and answer any questions, etc. 

 

We've set this up for the greater TUG family - so please don't share it outside of the TUG, Lamar, or Baca groups. 

 

To RSVP just reply to this email and let us know you want to attend. 

 

Uke On!
