&#65279;Thank you Paul for forwarding my Shaila. Thank you Gary&#8230; and Mike (nice to meet you) &#128591;&#127997; for your thoughts. 

I shared the Tyson video only because it was just funny how I came across the NDT video and how we had just spoken about longer days&#8230;

I hadn&#8217;t questioned the lyrics of &#8220;autumn leaves&#8221; before. I think I felt the longer days were about longing&#8230; (like Mike said)

I don&#8217;t always understand all the lyrics in the songs I practice. Sometimes the lyrics get in the way of the feeling of the song&#8230;

Hope you are all well. I&#8217;m looking forward to Tuesday.

&#65279;hi,

maybe improve the lyrics by changing it to ... the nights grow
long...? referring to longing and nights is maybe better than shorter
and days...?

originally it's probably poetic license by johnny mercer... longing
for someone, the hours are long away from you, gotta get the word long
in there somehow! but a physicist writing lyrics wouldn't come out as
good, even if it would be more scientifically accurate, lol.

the original french lyrics are different too...

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We love Neil Degrasse Tyson.  We have even seen him in person.  My take away from what he said is that starting after June 21st, the longest day of the year, the days start getting shorter.  That would continue until December 21st, the shortest day of the year, and winter officially begins.  After that point the days start getting longer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the lyrics have nothing to do with the actual length of the day and everything to do with the guy's broken heart.  He is lonely and bored, so to him the days do seem long.  And since he is observing the autumn leaves falling and faced with the approach of winter, he needs to call his girl friend and apologize to her for whatever bone headed thing he did.  If not, he&#8217;s going to need to find a therapist.
