<PRE> Paul,omg that Tommy the Cat video is amazing!!!!! I love the milk shots and cartoons mixed into the frantic music &amp; scene.
Your chord suggestions are way over my head though.&#160;How can I catch up with all of this? Time for music lessons!

 Christine,
As Vany wrote, 0232 is Cdim/G, but in the context of your song, that mystery chord seems to me like it's trying to be G#7 (because in the song, you always slide down to G7 immediately after the G#7). G#7 would be 1323, not 0323, or you could only strum three of the strings: x323.&#160;
I also think you could fairly name 0232 as G#7/G. I kind of expect a G#7/G to have too much dissonance between the G and G#, but the ukulele chord 0323 does not actually contain a G# (the notes are G, D#, F#, C), so the dissonance is implied without being overpowering. There is still the dissonance between the G and F#, but on my low-G uke, that is nearly an octave apart. I'd expect that dissonance to be more in-your-face on a high-G uke. Since this chord always appears during the cat's ah-wooing, a little intentional dissonance seems to fit the song really well.
By the way, here's the cat song I mentioned on Tuesday (<A HREF="https://youtu.be/r4OhIU-PmB8">https://youtu.be/r4OhIU-PmB8</A>). Anybody who recently acquired&#160;a bass uke might want to watch this play-along version (<A HREF="https://youtu.be/h0Ckq7qRwSg">https://youtu.be/h0Ckq7qRwSg</A>).

 thank you paul for hosting TUG... it's really nice to play the uke with you all but of course, in person would be EVEN better. i will keep that hope going...
also i wanted to thank all the folks in the group for teaching me so much about the uke and all the new songs you introduce me to.maybe in future TUGs i will sing some of the songs i am learning from you all... like hello starlight, ripple, pancho &amp; lefty, i saw the light, vincent, that;s how i got to memphis, i'll follow the sun, and more...
also christine, is the G in your song supposed to be G7 (0212) and then the 0323 chord might be Cdim/G? do i have number nomenclature correct? it's always a little confusing to me.

stay well and ukulele on...vany
