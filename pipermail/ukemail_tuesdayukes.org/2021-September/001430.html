<PRE>Hi,

This is just a shot in the dark, but figured it wouldn't hurt.  Anyway, I
find myself in a situation where I'm holding onto an Irish bouzouki
temporarily for a family member who is moving out of the country.  It needs
a set up and to have the strings changed.  I've been told that the string
change can be tricky due to a floating bridge (?).  Does anyone know of a
reputable local luthier who might be able to handle the set up/string
change?

Also, I'm hoping to find a hard shell case for it.  The person I'm holding
it for is skeptical that it would be likely to find something online that
is sized properly (I have no idea, having no bouzouki background) and that
ordering online could turn into quite an exercise of ordering/returning
hard cases until finding one that is &quot;just right.&quot;  (It's in a padded gig
bag for an Irish bouzouki, but the bag is oversized.)  And, nobody local
stocks them, so nothing to go look at in person (at least, that I've found,
so far).  It is a Luna instrument; per Luna's website, they have hard shell
cases for a variety of guitars and ukuleles, but nothing for bouzoukis.

Anyway, if anyone has a suggestion to pass along, it would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Glenn
