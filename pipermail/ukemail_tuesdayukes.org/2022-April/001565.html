<PRE>Hey,

I went to the Austin Friends of Traditional Music's Old-Time Slow Jam this
past Saturday and got a chance to play with fiddlers, banjo players and
guitarists (apparently, mandolin players often show up, as well).  It was
the first in-person jam for this group since the pandemic.  Anyway, there
were couple of other ukers there besides me and the host asked us to be
sure to put the word out that ukulele players are most welcome.  The folks
in the group could not have been nicer.  You can click on the link and
subscribe to their email list (look under &quot;Group Email Addresses&quot;) to learn
more.  They meet the first Saturday of the month.

Also, there is a group that meets at the Round Rock Public Library on the
second Saturday of the month, the &quot;Library Acoustic Open Jam&quot;.  The
organizer has confirmed that all instruments are welcome except for full
drum kits (sorry drummers).  I not 100% sure, but think that this formerly
was a bluegrass jam under the umbrella of the Central Texas Bluegrass Assn,
but that one shut down with the pandemic.  It now has a new name and new
organizer, so maybe it's unrelated to the bluegrass jam.  For what it's
worth, I attended one of the bluegrass jams just before the pandemic hit
and the group was most welcoming to a uker.

The uke is actually quite versatile in regard to bluegrass and old-time
music.  From a pure rhythm standpoint, a fairly passable mandolin chop can
be played on uke.  With a high-G, clawhammer banjo parts and banjo rolls
can be played (a 5-string banjo also uses re-entrant tuning with a high-G
5th string).  And, if one has some flatpicking background (or wants to
develop one), guitar parts can be played (low-G may be more suitable for
flatpicking guitar parts).

Anyway, just something to think about for anyone interested in broadening
their musical horizons a little bit.
